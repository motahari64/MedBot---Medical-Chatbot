            "Human: Use the given text to generate a question from the following input: [\"What is osteoarthritis? Osteoarthritis is a painful problem with the joints. Healthy joints help your body move, bend, and twist. Knees glide up and down stairs without creaking or crunching. Hips move you along on a walk without a complaint. But when you have arthritis, such simple, everyday movements can hurt. Using the stairs can be painful. Walking a few steps, opening a door, and even combing your hair can be hard.\\n\\nArthritis is mainly a disease of the spine, hip, hand, knee, and foot. But it can happen in other joints too. A joint is where two bones connect. And you have them all over your body.\\n\\nArthritis is most common in older people. Even though you can't cure arthritis, there are many treatments that can help with your pain and make it easier for you to move. And you can do things to keep the damage from getting worse.\\n\\nWhat causes osteoarthritis? The simplest way to describe arthritis is that it's wear and tear on the cartilage of your joints. This cushioning tissue is firm, thick, and slippery. It covers and protects the ends of bones where they meet to form a joint.\\n\\nWith arthritis, there are changes in the cartilage that cause it to break down. When it breaks down, the bones rub together and cause damage and pain. Experts don't know why this breakdown in cartilage happens. But aging, joint injury, being overweight, and genetics may be a part of the reason.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? Pain. Your joints may ache, or the pain may feel burning or sharp. Stiffness. Getting up in the morning can be hard. Your joints may feel stiff and creaky for a short time, until you get moving. Muscle weakness. The muscles around the joint may get weaker. This happens a lot with arthritis in the knee. Deformed joints. Joints can start to look like they are the wrong shape, especially as arthritis gets worse. Reduced range of motion and loss of use of the joint. As your arthritis gets worse, you may not be able to fully bend, flex, or extend your joints. Or you may not be able to use them at all. Cracking and creaking. Your joints may make crunching, creaking sounds. How is osteoarthritis diagnosed? Your doctor will check that your pain is not caused by another problem. He or she will ask questions about your symptoms, such as:\\n\\nIs the pain burning, aching, or sharp? Are your joints stiff in the morning? If yes, how long does the stiffness last? Do you have any joint swelling? If your joints are tender and swollen and the muscles are weak, this will also help your doctor confirm whether you have arthritis. You may also have X-rays to check your joints for damage. Your doctor may want to do blood tests or other tests to see if there are other causes for your pain.\\n\\nHow is it treated? There are many treatments for arthritis, but what works for someone else may not help you. Work with your doctor to find what is best for you. Often a mix of things helps the most.\\n\\nYour treatment may include:\", \"Your treatment may include:\\n\\nUsing pain medicine. If your pain is mild, over-the-counter pain medicines such as acetaminophen (for example, Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help. Commonly used NSAIDs include ibuprofen (such as Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (such as Aleve). But if these don't get rid of your pain, you may need a stronger prescription medicine. Having shots of medicine in the joint also helps some people. Using heat or ice on the painful joint. Heat may help you loosen up before an activity. Ice is a good pain reliever after activity or exercise. Your doctor may give you gels or creams that you can rub on the joint to make it stop hurting. Losing weight, if you're overweight. Losing weight may be one of the best things you can do for your arthritis. It helps take some of the stress off of your joints. Exercising to strengthen your muscles. Having stronger thigh muscles, for example, can help reduce stress on your knees. Swimming, biking, and walking are good activities. But make sure you talk to your doctor about what kind of activity is best for you. You may also get help from a physical therapist. Having surgery. If the pain in your hip or knee does not get better with treatment, you may decide to have surgery to replace the joint. There are also some things you can do at home to help relieve your symptoms.\\n\\nFor example, there are devices and tools that can take the stress and weight off of your joints and make it easier for you to hold objects, open and close things, and walk. Doorknob covers, tape, braces, splints, and canes may help.\\n\\nYou might also try changing activities or the way you do things to reduce the stress on the joint that hurts and allow you to move better. For example, walk instead of jog. Or use a sewing machine to make a quilt instead of making it by hand.\", 'Cancer: Controlling Nausea and Vomiting From Chemotherapy Introduction Of all the side effects of chemotherapy, nausea and vomiting are two of the most distressing. But in many cases, nausea and vomiting can be controlled and even prevented.\\n\\nNausea and vomiting can be controlled and even prevented. The best treatment plan is one set up by you and your health care team, based on your particular needs and feelings. You are the authority on how well you feel and how much nausea you have. Today\\'s antinausea drugs are very good at preventing and controlling nausea and vomiting. Your doctor should be able to find one that works for you. Prevent nausea. When you or your doctor foresee that a treatment will make you very sick, it\\'s best that you take antinausea medicine beforehand. There are several other ways to get relief and make yourself feel better before and after your chemotherapy treatments.\\n\\nHow can I control nausea and vomiting? The best way to control nausea and vomiting is to begin treatment for it before you start chemotherapy. Talk to your doctor about your treatment plan. Find out if the cancer drug you\\'ll receive is likely to make you sick. Ask your doctor what medicines are available to prevent nausea and vomiting. Talk about your concerns, no matter how small. The more you know about your treatment, the more you will feel in control and the easier it will be to talk about it with your doctors and nurses.\\n\\nAntinausea drugs Antinausea drugs are usually taken on a regular daily schedule for as long as chemotherapy lasts. Sometimes you may be asked to take the antinausea drug \"only as needed.\" You may be given more than one kind of antinausea drug. Drugs to relieve your nausea include aprepitant (Emend) and ondansetron (Zofran) .\\n\\nAntinausea drugs can be given as pills you swallow, through your vein (IV), or as shots. Some drugs are available as suppositories, as capsules that melt in your mouth, or as a patch that is taped to your skin.\\n\\nBe sure to follow your doctor\\'s instructions for taking your antinausea medicines and to report back about how well they are working.\\n\\nIf you have nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy in spite of taking antinausea drugs, tell your doctor. A different antinausea drug may be the answer.\\n\\nMedical marijuana Marijuana, either in its natural form or as a synthetic drug, has been shown to ease the nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. Although it worked better than many of the antinausea drugs available in the past, it doesn\\'t seem to work as well as other medicines available today. And marijuana can cause unpleasant side effects including dry mouth, low blood pressure, and dizziness, especially in older people or people who haven\\'t used it before. Also, the legality of marijuana for medical use is still a question in many countries.\\n\\nSome doctors still use the synthetic form of marijuana to treat nausea and vomiting. These drugs have not been shown to work as well as other drugs now available, but they may be helpful for certain people.footnote1\\n\\nComplementary therapy Although drugs are the main way to treat nausea and vomiting, there are other treatments that have been shown to work well.footnote1 They involve the help of a qualified therapist who can teach you to use your mind and body to control nausea and vomiting. These techniques help stop anticipatory nausea and vomiting. They work by relaxing you, distracting your attention, helping you feel in control, and making you feel less helpless. These treatments include:', \"Biofeedback. Biofeedback uses the mind to control a body function that the body normally regulates on its own, such as skin temperature, muscle tension, or heart rate. Guided imagery. This is a series of thoughts and suggestions that direct your imagination toward a relaxed, focused state. This technique can help you mentally block the nausea and vomiting. Distraction . For example, kids getting chemotherapy may use a video game to help keep their mind off what is happening. This may also help mentally block the nausea and vomiting. Progressive muscle relaxation . This is a technique in which you learn to relax by tensing and then releasing different groups of muscles, one at a time. Self-hypnosis. A therapist can teach you to hypnotize yourself. Some people are able to learn from books. Acupuncture Some studies have shown that acupuncture is an effective treatment for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.footnote2 Your doctor may refer you to a qualified acupuncturist.\\n\\nYou can also try acupressure. Constant pressure on the P6 point is used to prevent or reduce nausea. The P6 point is on the inner side of your arm, in line with your middle finger. It is close to your wrist, one-sixth of the distance between your wrist and elbow. You can press on your arm with a thumb or finger or try wearing wristbands (such as Sea-Bands) that press a plastic disc on the P6 point on each arm.\\n\\nNutrition Eating well may seem to be an odd way to treat nausea and vomiting, but it's very important. As a cancer patient, you need nutritious foods to help you feel better, keep up your strength and energy, keep up your weight, and keep up your ability to fight infection and recover as quickly as possible.\\n\\nHere are some tips for eating well during chemotherapy:\\n\\nEat small, frequent meals or snacks. Treat yourself by choosing the foods you like best. Make the most of the days when your appetite is good. Ask friends and family for help with shopping and preparing meals. Consider having meals delivered to your home or have lunch at a community or senior center. Nutritional supplements are convenient and can help you get the extra calories and protein you need. Try a variety to find out which ones work best. Your doctor, nurse, or dietitian can help and may have samples for you to try. Is there a time of day when you are able to eat more? Many people find that breakfast time is best. Try eating more during that time of day when you can. Don't force yourself to eat when you are nauseated. Eat food cold or at room temperature. Keep your mouth clean, and brush your teeth after vomiting. Have fresh air with a fan or an open window. Limit sounds, sights, and smells that make you feel sick. When you don't feel like eating your normal foods, try apple or grape juice, weak teas, clear broths, dry toast, cooked cereal, and gelatin desserts. Avoid citrus juices and lemonade. Try ginger, such as candied ginger or ginger tea. Real ginger—not ginger flavoring—helps to reduce nausea. Eat a light meal or snack before your chemotherapy appointment so that you have something in your stomach. If your chemotherapy is the kind that takes several hours rather than a few minutes, bring a light meal or snacks with you.\\n\\nYour treatment center should have a refrigerator and microwave available for your use.\", 'Influenza (Seasonal Flu) Reading medicine labels How to use a corticosteroid nasal spray Topic Overview What is influenza (flu)? Influenza (flu) is a viral infection. People often use the term \"flu\" to describe any kind of mild illness, such as a cold or a stomach virus, that has symptoms like the flu. But the real flu is different. Flu symptoms are usually worse than a cold and last longer. The flu usually does not cause vomiting or diarrhea in adults.\\n\\nMost flu outbreaks happen in late fall and winter. Because symptoms may not start for a couple of days, you may pass the flu to someone before you know you have it.\\n\\nWhat causes the flu? The flu is usually caused by influenza viruses A and B. There are different strains of the flu virus every year.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? The flu causes a fever, body aches, a headache, a dry cough, and a sore or dry throat. You will probably feel tired and less hungry than usual. The symptoms usually are the worst for the first 3 or 4 days. But it can take 1 to 2 weeks to get completely better.\\n\\nIt usually takes 1 to 4 days to get symptoms of the flu after you have been around someone who has the virus.\\n\\nMost people get better without problems. But sometimes the flu can lead to a bacterial infection, such as an ear infection, a sinus infection, or bronchitis. Less often, the flu may cause a more serious problem, such as pneumonia.\\n\\nCertain people are at higher risk of problems from the flu. They include young children, pregnant women, older adults, and people with long-term illnesses or with impaired immune systems that make it hard to fight infection.\\n\\nHow is the flu diagnosed? Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and examine you. This usually gives the doctor enough information to find out if you have the flu, especially if many cases of a similar illness have occurred in the area and the local health department reports a flu outbreak.\\n\\nIn some cases, the doctor may do a blood test or take a sample of fluid from your nose or throat to find out what type of flu virus you have.\\n\\nHow is it treated? Most people can treat flu symptoms at home. Home treatment includes resting, drinking plenty of fluids, and taking medicine to lower your fever. But some people need to go to the hospital for treatment. They may have severe symptoms or get pneumonia. Or the flu infection may make an existing health problem worse.\\n\\nIf you think you have the flu, your doctor may be able to give you medicine that can make the symptoms milder. It\\'s best to start taking it within 2 days of your first symptoms.\\n\\nCan the flu be prevented? You can help prevent the flu by getting the flu vaccine every year. It\\'s best to get the vaccine as soon as it\\'s available.\\n\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months old and older should get a flu vaccine. The vaccine is especially important for people who are at higher risk of problems from the flu, including:\\n\\nYoung children. Adults ages 50 and older. Adults and children who have long-term health problems or an impaired immune system. Women who will be pregnant during the flu season. The flu vaccine is also important for health care workers and anyone who lives or works with a person who is at higher risk of problems from the flu.\\n\\nThe vaccine usually prevents most cases of the flu. But even if you do get the flu after you\\'ve had the vaccine, your symptoms will be milder and you\\'ll have less chance of problems from the flu. You cannot get the flu from the flu vaccine.', \"Breathing Problems: Using a Metered-Dose Inhaler Using a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer (child) Using a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer (adult) Using a metered-dose inhaler without a spacer Introduction Diseases affecting the lungs—such as asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)—share many of the same medicines. These medicines are often delivered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI).\\n\\nUsing an MDI:\\n\\nDelivers most of a measured dose of medicine directly to your lungs. Can help keep your symptoms under control and minimize long-term damage to your lungs. May prevent or reduce side effects of the medicine. May let you use less medicine than is found in a pill but get the same effect. May result in the medicine working faster than a pill form.\\n\\nHow to use a metered-dose inhaler Getting started Talk with your doctor to be sure that you are using your MDI correctly. It might help if you practice using it in front of a mirror. Use the inhaler exactly as your doctor has prescribed. Check that you have the correct medicine. If you use several inhalers, put a label on each one so that you know which one to use at the right time. Check how much medicine is in the inhaler. Check the label of your inhaler medicine to see how many inhalations should be in the canister. If you know how many breaths you can take, you can replace your inhaler before you run out. Learn how to test your canister to estimate how much medicine is left. Your doctor or pharmacist can help you with this. Use a spacer if you have problems getting the correct timing when you use an inhaler or if you are using steroid medicine. Using an MDI Using a spacer with an MDI is the most efficient way to get the most medicine to your lungs. Make sure you understand the proper use of an:\\n\\nMDI with a spacer for a child. MDI with a spacer for an adult. Although using an MDI with a spacer is usually recommended, you can also use an MDI without a spacer. Learn the proper use of an:\\n\\nMDI without a spacer for an adult or child. If you are inhaling steroid medicine, rinse your mouth out with water after use. Don't swallow the water. Swallowing the water will increase the chance that the medicine will get into your bloodstream. This may increase the side effects of the medicine.\\n\\nSome liquid may build up on the inhaler, but you may not need to clean the inhaler every day. Follow the directions for how and how often to clean the type of MDI you have.\", 'COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) Chronic bronchitis Airways Inside the Lungs Emphysema Cardiovascular system Using a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer (adult) Lung Transplant Topic Overview What is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? COPD is a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. It is caused by damage to the lungs over many years, usually from smoking.\\n\\nCOPD is often a mix of two diseases:\\n\\nChronic bronchitis (say \"bron-KY-tus\"). In chronic bronchitis, the airways that carry air to the lungs (bronchial tubes) get inflamed and make a lot of mucus. This can narrow or block the airways, making it hard for you to breathe. Emphysema (say \"em-fuh-ZEE-muh\"). In a healthy person, the tiny air sacs in the lungs are like balloons. As you breathe in and out, they get bigger and smaller to move air through your lungs. But with emphysema, these air sacs are damaged and lose their stretch. Less air gets in and out of the lungs, which makes you feel short of breath. COPD gets worse over time. You can\\'t undo the damage to your lungs. But you can take steps to prevent more damage and to feel better.\\n\\nWhat causes COPD? COPD is almost always caused by smoking. Over time, breathing tobacco smoke irritates the airways and destroys the stretchy fibers in the lungs.\\n\\nOther things that may put you at risk include breathing chemical fumes, dust, or air pollution over a long period of time. Secondhand smoke also may damage the lungs.\\n\\nIt usually takes many years for the lung damage to start causing symptoms, so COPD is most common in people who are older than 60.\\n\\nYou may be more likely to get COPD if you had a lot of serious lung infections when you were a child. People who get emphysema in their 30s or 40s may have a disorder that runs in families, called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. But this is rare.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms?\\n\\nThe main symptoms are:\\n\\nA long-lasting (chronic) cough. Mucus that comes up when you cough. Shortness of breath that gets worse when you exercise. As COPD gets worse, you may be short of breath even when you do simple things like get dressed or fix a meal. It gets harder to eat or exercise, and breathing takes much more energy. People often lose weight and get weaker.\\n\\nAt times, your symptoms may suddenly flare up and get much worse. This is called a COPD exacerbation (say \"egg-ZASS-er-BAY-shun\"). An exacerbation can range from mild to life-threatening. The longer you have COPD, the more severe these flare-ups will be.\\n\\nHow is COPD diagnosed? To find out if you have COPD, a doctor will:\\n\\nDo a physical exam and listen to your lungs. Ask you questions about your past health and whether you smoke or have been exposed to other things that can irritate your lungs. Have you do breathing tests, including spirometry, to find out how well your lungs work. Do chest X-rays and other tests to help rule out other problems that could be causing your symptoms. Do an Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) blood test. AAT is a protein your body makes that helps protect the lungs. People who have a low AAT are more likely to get emphysema. This test only needs to be done once. If there is a chance you could have COPD, it is very important to find out as soon as you can. This gives you time to take steps to slow the damage to your lungs.\\n\\nHow is it treated? The best way to slow COPD is to quit smoking. This is the most important thing you can do. It is never too late to quit. No matter how long you have smoked or how serious your COPD is, quitting smoking can help stop the damage to your lungs.\\n\\nYour doctor can prescribe treatments that may help you manage your symptoms and feel better.', \"Your doctor can prescribe treatments that may help you manage your symptoms and feel better.\\n\\nMedicines can help you breathe easier. Most of them are inhaled so they go straight to your lungs. If you get an inhaler, it is very important to use it just the way your health provider shows you. A lung (pulmonary) rehab program can help you learn to manage your disease. A team of health professionals can provide counseling and teach you how to breathe easier, exercise, and eat well. In time, you may need to use oxygen some or most of the time. People who have COPD are more likely to get lung infections, so you will need to get a flu vaccine every year. You should also get a pneumococcal shot. It may not keep you from getting pneumonia. But if you do get pneumonia, you probably won't be as sick.\\n\\nHow can you live well with COPD? There are many things you can do at home to stay as healthy as you can.\\n\\nAvoid things that can irritate your lungs, such as smoke and air pollution. Use an air filter in your home. Get regular exercise to stay as strong as you can. Eat well so you can keep up your strength. If you are losing weight, ask your doctor or dietitian about ways to make it easier to get the calories you need. Dealing with flare-ups: As COPD gets worse, you may have flare-ups when your symptoms quickly get worse and stay worse. It is important to know what to do if this happens. Your doctor may give you an action plan and medicines to help you breathe if you have a flare-up. But if the attack is severe, you may need to go to the emergency room or call 911.\\n\\nManaging depression and anxiety: Knowing that you have a disease that gets worse over time can be hard. It's common to feel sad or hopeless sometimes. Having trouble breathing can also make you feel very anxious. If these feelings last, be sure to tell your doctor. Counseling, medicine, and support groups can help you cope.\", \"Gallstones: Should I Have Gallbladder Surgery? You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them.\\n\\nGallstones: Should I Have Gallbladder Surgery?\\n\\nGet the facts Your options Have surgery to remove your gallbladder. Don't have surgery. Wait and see if you have another attack. Key points to remember If you feel comfortable managing mild and infrequent gallstone attacks, and if your doctor thinks that you aren't likely to have serious complications, it's okay not to have surgery. Most doctors recommend surgery if you have had repeated attacks. If you have had one attack of gallstone pain, you may want to wait to see whether you have more. Surgery is the best way to prevent gallstone attacks. The surgery is very common, so doctors have a lot of experience with it. Your body will work fine without a gallbladder. There may be small changes in how you digest food, but you probably won't notice them. FAQs What are gallstones? Gallstones are stones made of cholesterol and other things found in bile. They form in the gallbladder or bile duct. They may be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball.\\n\\nMost people with gallstones have no symptoms and don't need treatment. Those who do have symptoms often have surgery to remove the gallbladder.\\n\\nIn people who do have symptoms, the most common one is pain in the upper right area of your belly. Other symptoms include nausea and vomiting.\\n\\nSymptoms usually don't come back after the gallbladder has been removed.\\n\\nIf gallstones block a duct, you may get jaundice. Jaundice makes your skin and the whites of your eyes yellow. It can also cause dark urine and light-colored stools.\\n\\nWhat is the surgery to remove the gallbladder? Laparoscopic gallbladder surgery is the most common surgery done to remove the gallbladder. The doctor inserts a lighted viewing instrument called a laparoscope and surgical tools into your belly through several small cuts. This type of surgery is very safe. People who have it usually recover enough in 7 to 10 days to go back to work or to their normal routine.\\n\\nOpen gallbladder surgery involves taking the gallbladder out through one larger incision in your belly. Open surgery may be done if laparoscopic surgery is not an option or when problems are found during laparoscopic surgery. The hospital stay is longer with open surgery.\\n\\nStones in the bile duct\\n\\nIf gallstones are found in the common bile duct before or during surgery to remove the gallbladder, a doctor may do a procedure called an ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram). This involves putting a tube called an endoscope down your throat to your small intestine. The doctor uses the scope to look for stones in the duct and remove them.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of gallbladder surgery? The overall risk from laparoscopic gallbladder surgery is very low. The most serious risks include:\\n\\nInfection. Bleeding. Injury to the common bile duct. Injury to the small intestine by one of the tools used during surgery. Risks from open gallbladder surgery include:\\n\\nInjury to the common bile duct. Bleeding. Infection. Injuries to the liver, intestines, or major blood vessels in the belly. Blood clots or pneumonia related to the longer recovery period after open surgery. Both surgeries have the risks of general anesthesia.\\n\\nPostcholecystectomy syndrome\\n\\nAfter gallbladder surgery (cholecystectomy), a few people have ongoing symptoms, such as belly pain, bloating, gas, or diarrhea. This is called postcholecystectomy syndrome. These symptoms can be treated with medicines.\", 'Caregiver Support: Talking About Advance Care Planning Topic Overview When your loved one is diagnosed with a life-limiting illness, it is important to keep communication as clear and direct as possible. Work at keeping the lines of communication open with your loved one, with his or her doctor, and with your family. Recognize your family\\'s style of communication. How did your family communicate before your loved one was diagnosed with this serious illness?

But you can control these symptoms with medicine and by avoiding the things that cause them (allergens). If you are allergic to indoor allergens, such as dust mites, animal dander, and mold, you can take some simple steps to get them out of your house.\\n\\nBy doing these things, you may have fewer symptoms or less severe symptoms.\\n\\nHow can I control allergens in my home? First, work with your doctor to find out what you're allergic to. When you know what triggers your allergies, you can take steps to control those allergens in your home.\\n\\nTo reduce allergens inside your home, you can:\\n\\nRemove items where allergens build up, such as stuffed animals or rugs. Use regular cleaning and housekeeping to prevent allergens from building up. Control dust and dust mites, such as dusting regularly and washing bed linens in hot water. Dust contains most of the allergens in your home. Control animal dander and other pet allergens, which includes keeping pets only in certain areas of your home. Control molds, which includes cleaning bathtubs and showers monthly. Adults spend one-third of their time and children spend half of their time in their bedrooms, so it is important to take steps to prevent allergens in this room.\\n\\nOther things you can do Polluted air does not cause allergies, but it can irritate the nose and lungs. This may make it more likely that you will have symptoms.\\n\\nAvoid tobacco smoke, smoke from wood-burning stoves, and fumes from kerosene heaters. If you have a wood-burning stove, try to use one that is airtight and does not leak smoke into your home.\", 'Controlling Indoor Mold Topic Overview Mold can get into a building through open doorways, windows, vents, and heating and air conditioning systems. Mold in the air outside can also attach itself to clothing, shoes, bags, and pets and can be carried indoors. Mold will grow in places that have a lot of moisture, such as around leaky roofs, windows, or pipes, or flooded areas. Mold grows well on paper products, cardboard, ceiling tiles, and wood products. Mold can also grow in dust, paints, wallpaper, insulation, drywall, carpet, and fabrics.\\n\\nIndoor mold (fungus) is very common in humid areas and in homes that have damp areas such as basements. Mold may trigger asthma symptoms, such as wheezing or coughing, or another allergic reaction, such as the rash of atopic dermatitis or stuffy nose of allergic rhinitis. Substances that trigger these reactions are called allergens.\\n\\nAlthough there is no strong evidence that reducing damp areas in homes or limiting exposure to them helps reduce allergy and asthma symptoms, taking the following steps may help keep mold out of the house or limit its growth.\\n\\nClean bathroom surfaces with soap and water, mold-killing products, or liquid bleach mixed with water. If you have mold in your home, remove it with one of these methods. Use bleach with caution, because it may irritate your nose. Keep the house aired out and dry. This may be difficult in some seasons and some climates. Use an exhaust fan in bathrooms and the kitchen to vent excess moisture. Make sure your clothes dryer vents moist air to the outside. Use a dehumidifier or air conditioner during humid weather. Try to keep the humidity in the home below 50%. Molds thrive in higher humidity. You can use a moisture or humidity meter to find out how humid it is in your home. Many hardware stores sell this device. Seal off or avoid damp areas, such as crawl spaces, attics, or basements. Use a dehumidifier to control mold growth in these areas. Try to avoid materials that have been stored in these areas. Remove carpeting from rooms that may have a lot of moisture, such as the bathroom and basement. Repair any water-damaged areas from leaking roofs or basements. Also, check the areas under sinks and around other plumbing for leaks. These areas can be prime mold-growing areas. Inspect closets for items, such as shoes, that may retain moisture. Add a mold inhibitor product to paint that you use in the home. Store fireplace wood outside the home.\\n\\nAdults spend one-third of their time and children spend half of their time in their bedrooms, so it is important that you take steps to prevent allergens in this room.', \"Asthma: Taking Charge of Your Asthma Introduction During an asthma attack, the airways swell and narrow. This makes it hard to breathe. Although asthma is a lifelong disease, treatment can help control it and help you stay healthy.\\n\\nYou and your doctor will make an asthma action plan that outlines the two approaches to taking charge of asthma:\\n\\nControlling asthma over the long term.

This can keep asthma under control and help you avoid asthma attacks. Keep your treatment goals in mind. This may help you stay on your treatment. Review your list of triggers. Avoiding triggers can help reduce the chance that you will have an asthma attack. Know your asthma zones An action plan is based on zones that are defined by your symptoms, your peak flow, or both. There are three zones: green, yellow, and red. Your action plan tells you what to do when you are in each zone.\\n\\nCheck your symptoms or your peak flow, or both, on a regular basis, and use your action plan to see what zone you are in. If you have yellow zone symptoms or if your peak flow drops below 80% of your personal best measurement, follow your action plan. To figure out what 80% of your personal best measurement is, multiply your personal best measurement by 0.80. For example, if your personal best peak flow is 400, then 80% of that is 400 times 0.80, which is 320. To figure what 50% of your personal best peak flow is, multiply your personal best measurement by 0.50.\\n\\nGreen means Go. You are in the green zone if your peak flow is 80% to 100% of your personal best measurement.\\n\\nThis is where you want to be. Keep taking your daily asthma medicines as prescribed.\\n\\nYellow means Caution. You are in the yellow zone if your peak flow is 50% to 79% of your personal best measurement. You may not have any symptoms, but your lung function is reduced. When symptoms are present, you may cough, wheeze, or feel short of breath. Or your asthma may limit your activities or wake you up at night.\\n\\nYou should take action. Your action plan will tell you what medicines you need to take, how much to take, and when to take them. If you keep going into the yellow zone from the green zone, talk with your doctor. You may need a different medicine or the dose of your medicine may need to be increased.\\n\\nRed means DANGER. You are in the red zone if your peak flow is less than 50% of your personal best measurement. You may be very short of breath. Or the quick-relief medicines may not have worked.

The glands (lymph nodes) on either side of the neck, under the jaw, or behind the ears commonly swell when you have a cold or sore throat.\\n\\nMore serious infections may cause the glands to enlarge and become very firm and tender. Glands can also swelland become tender after an injury, such as a cut or bite, or when a tumor or infection occurs in the mouth, head, or neck.\\n\\nSwollen glands and other lumps under the skin can be caused by many different things, including illness, infection, or another cause.\\n\\nInfections Swollen glands commonly develop when the body fights infections from colds, insect bites, or small cuts. More serious infections may cause the glands to enlarge and become firm, hard, or tender. Examples of such infections include:\\n\\nBacterial infections, such as: Strep throat, caused by the streptococcus bacterium. A boil (abscess), similar to a large pimple. A boil may develop when a hair follicle or the skin becomes infected. A sweat gland abscess may form one or more lumps in the armpit that look like boils. Viral infections, such as: A viral infection of the skin (molluscum contagiosum), which causes small pearly or flesh-colored bumps. Measles, rubella, chickenpox, or mumps. AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), which develops in the late stage of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection. This virus attacks the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight off infection and some diseases. Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus) or cytomegalovirus (CMV). These viruses cause fever, sore throat, and fatigue. Other infections, such as: Lyme disease, an infection that is spread by certain types of ticks. Syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection. Noncancerous (benign) growths Types of noncancerous (benign) growths, which are usually harmless, include:\\n\\nA lipoma, a smooth, rubbery, dome-shaped lump that is easily movable under the skin. A cyst, a sac of fluid and debris that sometimes hurts. Cystic lesions from acne are large pimples that occur deep under the skin. Branchial cleft cysts are found in the neck and do not usually cause problems unless they become infected. These cysts are most common in teenagers. An epidermal cyst often appears on the scalp, ears, face, or back. A ganglion is a soft, rubbery lump (a type of cyst) on the front or back of the wrist. Tonsillitis, which may also cause swelling in the neck. A salivary gland problem, such as inflammation, a salivary stone, an infection, or a tumor. An inflammation of fatty tissue under the skin (erythema nodosum) or overgrown scar tissue (keloid). Hernias, aneurysms, or nodules Hernias or aneurysms are bulging sections in a muscle or blood vessel. A nodule is usually a growth on a gland. A hernia, aneurysm, or nodule may be felt under the skin but may not be visible. These types of lumps may need more medical evaluation.\\n\\nAn inguinal hernia is a soft lump in the groin or near the navel. It may be more visible when you cough. Hernias that disappear when you press on them may not need any treatment. Hernias that don't disappear when you press on them may be more serious and need medical treatment. A bulging section in the wall of a blood vessel (aneurysm) may feel like a pulsating lump in the abdomen, in the groin, or behind the knee. It can cause serious problems if it involves the blood vessels in the brain or the abdomen. Aneurysms may be a medical emergency and may require immediate evaluation. A thyroid nodule is an abnormal growth on the thyroid gland. An enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) is in the neck just below the Adam's apple. Swelling caused by cancer A lump caused by cancer is usually hard, irregularly shaped, and firmly fixed under the skin or deep in tissue. Although they usually do not cause pain, some types of cancerous lumps are painful. Most lumps are not caused by cancer.\", 'Other causes Swelling may also be caused by:\\n\\nA side effect of a medicine, such as phenytoin (Dilantin). Other medical conditions and diseases, such as lupus, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Dizziness: Lightheadedness and Vertigo Digestive System Taking a pulse (Heart Rate) Topic Overview Dizziness is a word that is often used to describe two different feelings. It is important to know exactly what you mean when you say \"I feel dizzy,\" because it can help you and your doctor narrow down the list of possible problems.\\n\\nLightheadedness is a feeling that you are about to faint or \"pass out.\" Although you may feel dizzy, you do not feel as though you or your surroundings are moving. Lightheadedness often goes away or improves when you lie down. If lightheadedness gets worse, it can lead to a feeling of almost fainting or a fainting spell (syncope). You may sometimes feel nauseated or vomit when you are lightheaded. Vertigo is a feeling that you or your surroundings are moving when there is no actual movement. You may feel as though you are off balance, spinning, whirling, falling, or tilting. When you have severe vertigo, you may feel very nauseated or vomit. You may have trouble walking or standing, and you may lose your balance and fall. Although dizziness can occur in people of any age, it is more common among older adults. A fear of dizziness can cause older adults to limit their physical and social activities. Dizziness can also lead to falls and other injuries.\\n\\nLightheadedness It is common to feel lightheaded from time to time. Brief episodes of lightheadedness are not usually the result of a serious problem. Lightheadedness often is caused by a momentary drop in blood pressure and blood flow to your head that occurs when you get up too quickly from a seated or lying position (orthostatic hypotension). Ongoing lightheadedness may mean you have a more serious problem that needs to be evaluated.\\n\\nLightheadedness has many causes, including:\\n\\nAllergies. Illnesses such as the flu or colds. Home treatment of your flu and cold symptoms usually will relieve lightheadedness. Vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, and other illnesses that cause dehydration. Very deep or rapid breathing (hyperventilation). Anxiety and stress. The use of tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs. A more serious cause of lightheadedness is bleeding. Most of the time, the location of the bleeding and the need to seek medical care are obvious. But sometimes bleeding is not obvious (occult bleeding). You may have small amounts of bleeding in your digestive tract over days or weeks without noticing the bleeding. When this happens, lightheadedness and fatigue may be the first noticeable symptoms that you are losing blood. Heavy menstrual bleeding also can cause this type of lightheadedness.\\n\\nSometimes the cause of lightheadedness is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), which can cause fainting spells (syncope). Unexplained fainting spells need to be evaluated by a doctor. You can check your heart rate by taking your pulse.\\n\\nMany prescription and nonprescription medicines can cause lightheadedness or vertigo. The degree of lightheadedness or vertigo that a medicine causes will vary.\\n\\nVertigo Vertigo occurs when there is conflict between the signals sent to the brain by various balance- and position-sensing systems of the body. Your brain uses input from four sensory systems to maintain your sense of balance and orientation to your surroundings.', \"Vision gives you information about your position and motion in relationship to the rest of the world. This is an important part of the balance mechanism and often overrides information from the other balance-sensing systems. Sensory nerves in your joints allow your brain to keep track of the position of your legs, arms, and torso. Your body is then automatically able to make tiny changes in posture that help you maintain your balance (proprioception). Skin pressure sensation gives you information about your body's position and motion in relationship to gravity. A portion of the inner ear, called the labyrinth, which includes the semicircular canals, contains specialized cells that detect motion and changes in position. Injury to or diseases of the inner ear can send false signals to the brain indicating that the balance mechanism of the inner ear (labyrinth) detects motion. If these false signals conflict with signals from the other balance and positioning centers of the body, vertigo may occur. Common causes of vertigo include:\\n\\nInner ear disorders, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière's disease, vestibular neuritis, or labyrinthitis. Injury to the ear or head. Migraine headaches, which are painful, debilitating headaches that often occur with vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, noise, and smell. Decreased blood flow through the arteries that supply blood to the base of the brain (vertebrobasilar insufficiency). Less common causes of vertigo include:\\n\\nA noncancerous growth in the space behind the eardrum (cholesteatoma). Brain tumors and cancer that has traveled from another part of the body (metastatic). Immediate medical attention is needed if vertigo occurs suddenly with a change in speech or vision or other loss of function. Vertigo that occurs with loss of function in one area of the body can mean a problem in the brain, such as a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).\\n\\nAlcohol and many prescription and nonprescription medicines can cause lightheadedness or vertigo. These problems may develop from:\\n\\nTaking too much of a medicine (overmedicating). Alcohol and medicine interactions. This is a problem, especially for older adults, who may take many medicines at the same time. Misusing a medicine or alcohol use disorder. Drug intoxication or the effects of withdrawal.\", \"Diabetic Neuropathy Charcot Foot Topic Overview What is diabetic neuropathy? Neuropathy means nerve disease or damage. Diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage caused by diabetes. People who have diabetes often have high blood sugar levels. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage nerves throughout your body.\\n\\nThere are three kinds of diabetic neuropathy.\\n\\nPeripheral neuropathy is damage to peripheral nerves. These are the nerves that sense pain, touch, hot, and cold. They also affect movement and muscle strength. The nerves in the feet and lower legs are most often affected. This type of nerve damage can lead to serious foot problems. The damage usually gets worse slowly, over months or years. Autonomic neuropathy is damage to autonomic nerves. These nerves control things like your heartbeat, blood pressure, sweating, digestion, urination, and sexual function. Focal neuropathy affects just one nerve, usually in the wrist, thigh, or foot. It may also affect the nerves of your back and chest and those that control your eye muscles. This type of nerve damage usually happens suddenly. What causes diabetic neuropathy? Over time, high blood sugar levels from diabetes can damage nerves throughout your body. The higher your blood sugar levels, the more likely you are to have nerve damage. So controlling your blood sugar throughout your life is very important.\\n\\nThe older you get, and the longer you have diabetes, the more likely you are to have nerve damage. People who have diabetes who drink too much alcohol are also more likely to have nerve damage.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? Your symptoms will depend on which nerves are injured. You may not be able to feel pain, especially in your feet. This can lead to serious infections, because sores or other problems may not get treated.\\n\\nWhen other parts of your body are affected, symptoms may include:\\n\\nProblems with digestion, such as bloating, belching, constipation, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and belly pain. Problems with body temperature, such as heavy sweating at night or when you eat certain foods. Some people may have reduced sweating, especially in their feet and legs. Problems with urination, such as finding it hard to tell when your bladder is full or finding it hard to empty your bladder completely. Sexual problems, such as erection problems in men and vaginal dryness in women. Heart and blood vessel problems, leading to poor circulation or low blood pressure. This may cause dizziness, weakness, or fainting when you stand or sit up from a reclining position. Trouble sensing when your blood sugar is low. How is diabetic neuropathy diagnosed? Your doctor will check how well you feel light touch and temperature and will test your strength and your reflexes. Tests such as electromyogram and nerve conduction studies may be done to confirm the diagnosis. You may need other tests to see which type of neuropathy you have and to help guide your treatment.\\n\\nDoctors can't test for all types of nerve damage. So it's important to tell your doctor about any pain or weakness you feel. Also mention heavy sweating or dizziness and any changes in digestion, urination, and sexual function.\\n\\nHow is it treated? Treatment involves keeping blood sugar levels in your target range. This will not cure the nerve damage, but it can help keep the damage from getting worse, and the pain might get better.\\n\\nOther treatment depends on your symptoms:\\n\\nPain may be treated with medicines. Digestive system problems or blood vessel problems may be treated with medicines. Blood pressure problems may be treated with medicines and by wearing support stockings (also called compression stockings). Sexual problems may be helped with medicines or devices to improve erections or with lubricating creams that help vaginal dryness. A splint or brace may be used for a pinched nerve. When you have diabetes, you could have a sore or other foot problem without noticing it. Check your feet every day. An untreated problem on your foot can lead to a serious infection or even amputation.\", 'Be clear with your doctor about what is helping you feel better and what is not. You and your doctor can work together to find the treatment that helps you the most.\\n\\nCan diabetic neuropathy be prevented? Keeping your blood sugar levels in your target range, set with your doctor, may help prevent neuropathy from ever developing. The best way to do this is by checking your blood sugar and adjusting your treatment. It is also important to get to and stay at a healthy weight by exercising and eating healthy foods.', 'Depression in Children and Teens Topic Overview Is this topic for you?\\n\\nThis topic covers depression in children and teens. For information about depression in adults, see the topic Depression. For information about depression with episodes of high energy (mania), see the topic Bipolar Disorder in Children and Teens.\\n\\nWhat is depression in children and teens? Depression is a serious mood disorder that can take the joy from a child\\'s life. It is normal for a child to be moody or sad from time to time. You can expect these feelings after the death of a pet or a move to a new city. But if these feelings last for weeks or months, they may be a sign of depression.\\n\\nExperts used to think that only adults could get depression. Now we know that even a young child can have depression that needs treatment to improve. As many as 2 out of 100 young children and 8 out of 100 teens have serious depression.footnote1\\n\\nStill, many children don\\'t get the treatment they need. This is partly because it can be hard to tell the difference between depression and normal moodiness. Also, depression may not look the same in a child as in an adult.\\n\\nIf you are worried about your child, learn more about the symptoms in children. Talk to your child to see how he or she is feeling. If you think your child is depressed, talk to your doctor or a counselor. The sooner a child gets treatment, the sooner he or she will start to feel better.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? A child may be depressed if he or she:\\n\\nIs irritable, sad, withdrawn, or bored most of the time. Does not take pleasure in things he or she used to enjoy. A child who is depressed may also:\\n\\nLose or gain weight. Sleep too much or too little. Feel hopeless, worthless, or guilty. Have trouble concentrating, thinking, or making decisions. Think about death or suicide a lot. The symptoms of depression are often overlooked at first. It can be hard to see that symptoms are all part of the same problem.\\n\\nAlso, the symptoms may be different depending on how old the child is.\\n\\nBoth very young children and grade-school children may lack energy and become withdrawn. They may show little emotion, seem to feel hopeless, and have trouble sleeping. Often they will lose interest in friends and activities they liked before. They may complain of headaches or stomachaches. A child may be more anxious or clingy with caregivers. Teens may sleep a lot or move or speak more slowly than usual. Some teens and children with severe depression may see or hear things that aren\\'t there (hallucinate) or have false beliefs (delusions). Depression can range from mild to severe. A child who feels a little \"down\" most of the time for a year or more may have a milder, ongoing form of depression called dysthymia (say \"dis-THY-mee-uh\"). In its most severe form, depression can cause a child to lose hope and want to die.\\n\\nWhether depression is mild or severe, there are treatments that can help.\\n\\nWhat causes depression? Just what causes depression is not well understood. But it is linked to a problem with activity levels in certain parts of the brain as well as an imbalance of brain chemicals that affect mood. Things that may cause these problems include:\\n\\nStressful events, such as changing schools, going through a divorce, or losing a close family member or friend. Some medicines, such as steroids or opioids for pain relief. Family history. In some children, depression seems to be inherited. How is depression diagnosed? To diagnose depression, a doctor may do a physical exam and ask questions about your child\\'s past health. You and your child may be asked to fill out a form about your child\\'s symptoms. The doctor may ask your child questions to learn more about how he or she thinks, acts, and feels.\\n\\nSome diseases can cause symptoms that look like depression. So the child may have tests to help rule out physical problems, such as a low thyroid level or anemia.', \"Some diseases can cause symptoms that look like depression. So the child may have tests to help rule out physical problems, such as a low thyroid level or anemia.\\n\\nIt is common for children with depression to have other problems too, such as anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or an eating disorder. The doctor may ask questions about these problems to help your child get the right diagnosis and treatment.\\n\\nHow is it treated? Usually one of the first steps in treating depression is education for the child and his or her family. Teaching both the child and the family about depression can be a big help. It makes them less likely to blame themselves for the problem. Sometimes it can help other family members see that they are also depressed.\\n\\nCounseling may help the child feel better. The type of counseling will depend on the age of the child. For young children, play therapy may be best. Older children and teens may benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy. This type of counseling can help them change negative thoughts that make them feel bad.\\n\\nMedicine may be an option if the child is very depressed. Combining antidepressant medicine with counseling often works best. A child with severe depression may need to be treated in the hospital.\\n\\nThere are some things you can do at home to help your child start to feel better.\\n\\nEncourage your child to get regular exercise, spend time with supportive friends, eat healthy foods, and get enough sleep. See that your child takes any medicine as prescribed and goes to all follow-up appointments. Make time to talk and listen to your child. Ask how he or she is feeling. Express your love and support. Remind your child that things will get better in time. What should you know about antidepressant medicines? Antidepressant medicines often work well for children who are depressed. But there are some important things you should know about these medicines.\\n\\nChildren who take antidepressants should be watched closely. These medicines may increase the risk that a child will think about or try suicide, especially in the first few weeks of use. If your child takes an antidepressant, learn the warning signs of suicide, and get help right away if you see any of them. Common warning signs include: Talking, drawing, or writing about death. Giving away belongings. Withdrawing from family and friends. Having a plan, such as a gun or pills. Your child may start to feel better after 1 to 3 weeks of taking antidepressant medicine. But it can take as many as 6 to 8 weeks to see more improvement. Make sure your child takes antidepressants as prescribed and keeps taking them so they have time to work. A child may need to try several different antidepressants to find one that works. If you notice any warning signs or have concerns about the medicine, or if you do not notice any improvement by 3 weeks, talk to your child's doctor. Do not let a child suddenly stop taking antidepressants. This could be dangerous. Your doctor can help you taper off the dose slowly to prevent problems.\", 'Depression\\n\\nWhat is depression? Depression is an illness that causes you to feel sad, lose interest in activities that you\\'ve always enjoyed, withdraw from others, and have little energy. It\\'s different from normal feelings of sadness, grief, or low energy. Depression can also cause people to feel hopeless about the future and even think about suicide.\\n\\nMany people, and sometimes their families, feel embarrassed or ashamed about having depression. Don\\'t let these feelings stand in the way of getting treatment. Remember that depression is a common illness. It affects the young and old, men and women, all ethnic groups, and all professions.\\n\\nIf you think you may be depressed, tell your doctor. Treatment can help you enjoy life again. The sooner you get treatment, the sooner you will feel better.\\n\\nWhat causes depression? Depression is a disease. It\\'s not caused by personal weakness and is not a character flaw. When you have depression, there may be problems with activity levels in certain parts of your brain, or chemicals in your brain called neurotransmitters may be out of balance.\\n\\nMost experts believe that a combination of family history (your genes) and stressful life events may cause depression. Life events can include a death in the family or having a long-term health problem.\\n\\nJust because you have a family member with depression or have stressful life events doesn\\'t mean you\\'ll get depression.\\n\\nYou also may get depressed even if there is no reason you can think of.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? The symptoms of depression may be hard to notice at first. They vary among people, and you may confuse them with just feeling \"off\" or with another health problem.\\n\\nThe two most common symptoms of depression are:\\n\\nFeeling sad or hopeless nearly every day for at least 2 weeks. Losing interest in or not getting pleasure from most daily activities that you used to enjoy, and feeling this way nearly every day for at least 2 weeks. A serious symptom of depression is thinking about death or suicide. If you or someone you care about talks about this or about feeling hopeless, get help right away.\\n\\nIf you think you may have depression, take a short quiz to check your symptoms:\\n\\nInteractive Tool: Are You Depressed? How is it treated? Depression can be treated in various ways. Counseling, psychotherapy, and antidepressant medicines can all be used. Lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise, also may help.\\n\\nWork with your health care team to find the best treatment for you. It may take a few tries, and it can take several weeks for the medicine and therapy to start working. Try to be patient and keep following your treatment plan.\\n\\nDepression can return (relapse). How likely you are to get depression again increases each time you have a bout of depression. Taking your medicines and continuing some types of therapy after you feel better can help keep that from happening. Some people need to take medicine for the rest of their lives. This doesn\\'t stop them from living full and happy lives.\\n\\nWhat can you do if a loved one has depression? If someone you care for is depressed, the best thing you can do is help the person get or stay in treatment. Learn about the disease. Talk to the person, and gently encourage him or her to do things and see people. Don\\'t get upset with the person. The behavior you see is the disease, not the person.', \"Stress Management: Doing Progressive Muscle Relaxation Introduction Have you ever had an aching back or pain in your neck when you were anxious or stressed? When you have anxiety or stress in your life, one of the ways your body responds is with muscle tension. Progressive muscle relaxation is a method that helps relieve that tension.\\n\\nIn progressive muscle relaxation, you tense a group of muscles as you breathe in, and you relax them as you breathe out. You work on your muscle groups in a certain order. When your body is physically relaxed, you cannot feel anxious. Practicing progressive muscle relaxation for a few weeks will help you get better at this skill, and in time you will be able to use this method to relieve stress. When you first start, it may help to use an audio recording until you learn all the muscle groups in order. Check your local library or a bookstore for progressive muscle relaxation audio recordings. If you have trouble falling asleep, this method may also help with your sleep problems.\\n\\nHow do you do progressive muscle relaxation? The procedure You can use an audio recording to help you focus on each muscle group, or you can learn the order of muscle groups and do the exercises from memory. Choose a place where you won't be interrupted and where you can lie down on your back and stretch out comfortably, such as a carpeted floor.\\n\\nBreathe in, and tense the first muscle group (hard but not to the point of pain or cramping) for 4 to 10 seconds. Breathe out, and suddenly and completely relax the muscle group (do not relax it gradually). Relax for 10 to 20 seconds before you work on the next muscle group. Notice the difference between how the muscles feel when they are tense and how they feel when they are relaxed. When you are finished with all of the muscle groups, count backward from 5 to 1 to bring your focus back to the present. After you have learned how to tense and relax each muscle group, here's something else to try. When you have a very tense muscle, you can practice tensing and relaxing that muscle area without going through the whole routine.\\n\\nThe muscle groups The following is a list of the muscle groups in order and how to tense them. Remember to lie down when you do this.\\n\\nMuscle group\\n\\nWhat to do\\n\\nHands\\n\\nClench them.\\n\\nWrists and forearms\\n\\nExtend them, and bend your hands back at the wrist.\\n\\nBiceps and upper arms\\n\\nClench your hands into fists, bend your arms at the elbows, and flex your biceps.\\n\\nShoulders\\n\\nShrug them (raise toward your ears).\\n\\nForehead\\n\\nWrinkle it into a deep frown.\\n\\nAround the eyes and bridge of the nose\\n\\nClose your eyes as tightly as you can.

Diabetes can damage the nerve endings and blood vessels in your feet, making you less likely to notice when your feet are injured. Diabetes can also interfere with your body's ability to fight infection. If you develop a minor foot injury, it could become an ulcer or develop into a serious infection. Ulcers can be found on the bottom of your feet, or on the top or bottom of your toes. With good foot care, you can prevent most of these problems.\\n\\nCaring for your feet is easy. Most of the care can be done when you are bathing and getting ready for bed. Preventing injury to your feet is merely a matter of wearing properly fitted shoes and socks at all times.\\n\\nThese steps can help keep your feet healthy:\\n\\nExamine your feet every day. And have your doctor examine your feet during every visit. Check your shoes for any loose objects or rough edges before you put them on. Look at foot care as part of your daily routine. Soon it will become as automatic as brushing your teeth. Don't use home remedies to treat foot problems. Home remedies can hurt your feet. Over-the-counter medicine designed to remove calluses could contain chemicals that could burn your skin. Also, trying to cut corns or calluses yourself could lead to infections. Get early treatment for any foot problem, even a minor one.\\n\\nHow do you care for your feet? Here's how you can get started caring properly for your feet.\\n\\nInspect your feet at least once a day. Look at all areas of your feet, including your toes. This is the most important part of your foot care. You can use a handheld mirror or magnifying mirror attached to the bathroom wall near the baseboard to inspect your feet. If you can't see well, have someone assist you. Wash your feet daily. Post the steps for foot-washing and nail care in your bathroom. Refer to the steps when you wash your feet so that they become a habit. Make sure you dry your feet and toes well before putting on shoes and socks. Wear shoes and socks that fit well. Soft shoes that have good support and that fit well (such as tennis shoes) are best for your feet. Use the checklist for shoes that fit well when you buy new shoes. Break in new shoes slowly by wearing them for a few hours each day and increasing the number of hours you wear them each week. Wear socks that do not have seams. Protect your feet from injury. Before you put on your shoes, check for objects (such as pebbles) or rough spots inside your shoes or objects pushing through the soles. Inspect your feet for blisters, cuts, or scrapes after activities such as hiking or skiing. If you can't see well, have someone do this for you. Post a list of precautions to protect your feet when you have diabetes in your closet near your shoes. Ask your doctor to check your feet during each visit. Your doctor may notice a foot problem you have missed.\\n\\nTake off your shoes and socks while you are waiting for your doctor. This will help remind your doctor to check your feet. Write down any minor problems or questions you may have about foot care, and take this with you when you visit your doctor. Get early treatment for foot problems. Call your doctor even for minor foot problems, unless you have already learned from your doctor how to handle these problems. Your doctor may refer you to a podiatrist or orthopedic surgeon if special treatment is needed. A serious problem can develop from what seems like a minor irritation. If a foot problem develops, you need to seek care early.\", \"Allergies: Should I Take Shots for Insect Sting Allergies? You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them.\\n\\nAllergies: Should I Take Shots for Insect Sting Allergies?\\n\\nGet the facts Your options Get allergy shots to make you less sensitive to insect stings and reduce the risk of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Do not get allergy shots. Instead try other things such as avoiding stinging insects and carrying epinephrine to deal with the risk of a severe allergic reaction. Key points to remember If you have been stung in the past and had an allergic reaction to the sting, you have a high risk of having a similar reaction if you are stung again. Allergy shots usually are recommended only for people who have already had an anaphylactic (life threatening) reaction to an insect sting. If you had an anaphylactic reaction in the past, allergy shots greatly reduce your risk of having another.footnote1 Whether you need allergy shots depends on your reaction to an insect sting in the past. You may not need allergy shots if you had a normal (localized) reaction, a larger local reaction, or one that caused swelling and redness to much of your body but did not cause anaphylaxis. If you have had allergy tests that found one or more sensitivities to insect stings, allergy shots can prevent life-threatening reactions and also make you less worried about insect stings. Allergy shots may not be safe for you if you have an autoimmune disease or take certain kinds of medicines (such as beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors). Allergy shots can hurt a little, may trigger anaphylaxis in some people, can be costly, and usually take 3 to 5 years to complete.\", \"Tips for Reducing Indoor Pollutants in Your Home\\n\\nTopic Overview\\n\\nExposure to indoor air pollutants can cause respiratory problems, such as asthma attacks, or diseases, such as lung cancer. Pollutants include smoke, pet dander, radon, mold, cleaning products, and other chemicals. You can create a healthier home by following the tips below.footnote1\\n\\nReduce allergens\\n\\nGroom pets often to reduce dander. Don't allow them to sleep in the bedroom with anyone who has asthma or allergies. If possible, keep them off carpets and furniture.\\n\\nChoose window coverings that are easy to clean, such as wood shades or blinds. Drapes are magnets for dust.\\n\\nCheck houseplants for mold. Repot or move them outside if the soil contains mold.\\n\\nDo not allow anyone to smoke in your home.\\n\\nEliminate carpeting and replace it with wood or tile flooring, if possible.\\n\\nIf the humidity level is more than 50% inside your house, dust mites and molds can be a problem. To control dust mites, get allergen-resistant covers for bedding. Wash sheets and blankets in hot water.\\n\\nUse high-efficiency bags in your vacuum cleaner or install a central vacuum system in your home.\\n\\nDon't store firewood indoors. Drying green firewood can contain mold spores.\\n\\nKeep trees and shrubs at least 3 ft (0.9 m) away from your house. Roots can provide an easy path for water into your basement or crawl space.\\n\\nKeep bathrooms, kitchen, and basement—places where allergens are likely to grow—clean and dry.\\n\\nControl moisture\\n\\nFix leaks and other sources of water intrusion, and remove water-damaged materials.\\n\\nMake sure your clothes dryer vents to the outside.\\n\\nInstall and keep clean hood exhaust fans in your kitchen. Make sure bathroom vents exhaust air outdoors and not into basements, crawl spaces, or inside the house.\\n\\nMake sure that exhaust fans don't draw too much air out, creating a negative-pressure situation in which the pressure inside the house is lower than outside. Negative pressure can reverse the flow of combustion gases from furnaces, gas stoves, and water heaters, and draw water vapor and dangerous carbon monoxide or nitrogen dioxide into your home.\\n\\nCaulk the interior and exterior of your home, especially around windows and vents.\\n\\nIf you're building a new home, install a waterproofing system that keeps moisture away from your foundation.\\n\\nKeep gutters and drains clean.\\n\\nRemove any water-damaged carpet. Replace it, if possible, with wood or tile flooring.\\n\\nAvoid heating problems\\n\\nMake sure fuel-burning furnaces, hot water heaters, and gas ranges are checked every year to ensure air intake and exhaust systems are adequate. It is best to have your water heater and furnace outside of your home—for example, in your garage.\\n\\nDo not use kerosene space heaters or unvented gas heaters as your primary source of heat.\\n\\nInstall a carbon monoxide detector in your home. Carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless. You may not notice it until you have health problems. If you see orange or sputtering flames in your gas furnace or stove, it may mean that you have a problem with carbon monoxide. Call a technician immediately.\\n\\nMake sure wood stoves and fireplaces have tight-fitting doors. Check flues and chimneys for cracks that could allow fumes into your house.\\n\\nCheck household furnishings\\n\\nMany furnishings contain formaldehyde and other organic compounds. When shopping for new furniture or cabinets, try to buy those that are made of solid hardwood, not particleboard, which usually has a wood-veneer finish. The wood veneer may be attached with glue that contains formaldehyde.\\n\\nIf someone living in your home has asthma, replace carpet with tile or wood flooring. If carpeting is necessary, use a product with a short nap, or use area rugs that can be cleaned regularly.\\n\\nIf you are remodeling, use gypsum board, plaster, or real wood for walls. Plastic or wood-fiber paneling may emit formaldehyde.\", \"If you are remodeling, use gypsum board, plaster, or real wood for walls. Plastic or wood-fiber paneling may emit formaldehyde.\\n\\nIf your house was built before 1978, the woodwork or other surfaces may be covered with lead paint. You can have the paint tested for lead. Do not sand or strip off the lead paint. But you can cover surfaces with wallpaper or other building material. Call an expert if you have to remove lead paint.\\n\\nBe careful with household products\\n\\nTake care when using cleaning products, paints, solvents, and pesticides. Try not to use them inside the house. If you must use them inside, use a fan to blow strong odors and fumes out of your home. Be aware that paint can release trace gases for months after you apply it. Try to use paint without volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\\n\\nUse nontoxic glue to install flooring or carpet.\\n\\nIf you strip furniture inside, use products that do not contain methylene chloride. And make sure you have enough ventilation.\\n\\nDo not mix cleaning products.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease that causes blurring of your central vision. The blurring happens because of damage to the macula, a small area at the back of the eye. The macula helps you see the fine detail in things that your eyes are focusing on.\\n\\nMacular degeneration makes it harder to do things that require sharp central vision, like reading, driving, and recognizing faces. It does not affect side vision, so it does not lead to complete blindness.\\n\\nThere are two types of macular degeneration—wet and dry. The dry form is by far the most common type. The wet form is much less common, but it happens more quickly and is more severe.\\n\\nYou may have either type in just one eye, but over time you may get it in the other eye too.\\n\\nWhat causes it? AMD is the result of damage to the light-detecting nerve cells in the part of the eye called the macula. The cause of the damage to the nerve cells is unknown. A person's genes and family history may play a role.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? The main symptom of AMD is dim or fuzzy central vision. Objects may look warped or smaller than they are. You may have a blank spot in your central vision. Symptoms can depend on the type of AMD. Dry AMD happens slowly. Wet AMD happens suddenly and is more severe.\\n\\nHow is it diagnosed? A doctor can usually detect AMD by doing a regular eye exam. The doctor will ask about your symptoms, past eye problems, and other health conditions. You may have some vision tests, including an ophthalmoscopy, visual acuity test, or Amsler grid test. These tests let your doctor check for signs of the disease.\\n\\nHow is macular degeneration treated? There is no cure for AMD. But certain treatments may delay vision loss.\\n\\nYour doctor can refer you to professionals who help people adjust to living with low vision.\\n\\nFor dry AMD, follow your doctor's advice for having regular exams and watching the condition at home, because dry AMD can sometimes develop into wet AMD. Certain vitamin and mineral supplements may help slow vision loss. Check with your doctor before taking any supplements. Some can have harmful side effects.\\n\\nTreatment for wet AMD can sometimes delay further damage to your central vision. But in most cases, wet AMD starts again. The main treatment for wet AMD is a medicine that is injected into your eye. Sometimes other treatments may be recommended.\\n\\nBecause wet AMD often causes rapid and severe loss of central vision, it is important not to delay treatment if your doctor recommends it.\\n\\nHow can you cope with the changes in your vision? To cope with AMD, try magnifying glasses, brighter lighting, and large-print books. Your doctor may refer you to an occupational therapist or rehabilitation specialist for help. Local agencies may offer services. You may have a range of emotions about AMD. If you feel very sad or hopeless, tell your doctor.\", \"Sprained Ankle: Using a Compression Wrap Applying a Compression Wrap for a Sprained Ankle Introduction Ankle sprains are common injuries that can result in lifelong problems. Some people with repeated or severe sprains can develop long-term joint pain and weakness. Treating a sprained ankle can help prevent ongoing ankle problems.\\n\\nIf an ankle sprain does not heal correctly, the joint may become unstable, resulting in a weakened and easily reinjured ankle. Proper initial care of your sprained ankle is critical.\\n\\nA compression wrap helps decrease swelling. If swelling is kept to a minimum, it may help your ankle feel better. Applying a compression wrap is easy and can be done at home. Elastic bandages are inexpensive and available at most drugstores. You can wear a protective brace, such as a splint or a device to keep your ankle from moving (immobilizer), over a compression wrap. This can help prevent further injury to your ankle when you try to bear weight on it.\\n\\nHow to apply a compression wrap To help control swelling, some doctors recommend wrapping your ankle with an elastic bandage, also called an ACE wrap. This product can be purchased at most drugstores. To apply a compression wrap:\\n\\nCut several horseshoe-shaped pieces of cloth felt to form a 0.5 in. (1.3 cm) thick pad. The pad will be placed (open end up) under the anklebone to help keep fluid out of the hollow place under your anklebone. Roll up the elastic bandage if it isn't already. Hold your ankle at about a 90-degree angle. Start where your toes meet the body of your foot. Hold the loose end of the bandage at the side of your foot. Wrap the bandage around the ball of your foot once, keeping it somewhat taut with a light pull. After this first wrap, slowly start circling your way around the arch of the foot. Pull the bandage diagonally from the bottom of the toes across the foot's top and circle it around the ankle. Now bring the bandage diagonally across the top of the foot and under the arch in a figure-eight pattern. When you get to the anklebone, wrap the bandage around the felt piece so it stays in place under the anklebone. Continue around the ankle and foot in a figure eight, moving toward the heel on the bottom and toward the calf at the top of the eight. The wrap should cover the entire foot and end several inches above the ankle. Most compression wraps are self-fastening or come with clip fasteners. If not, use tape to secure the end. The wrap should be snug but should not cut off circulation to the foot. Check your toes. If they become purplish or blue, cool to the touch, or numb or tingly, the wrap is too tight and should be loosened. Also, loosen the wrap at night before bedtime.\", \"Fitness: Increasing Core Stability Breathing with your diaphragm Spine Pulling your belly in Bridging Introduction Increasing your core stability means making the muscles of your trunk stronger to keep your spine and body stable. This helps you stay balanced when you move.\\n\\nCore stability benefits everyone, from older people to top professional athletes.\\n\\nHow can I increase my core strength and stability? Core stability exercises are easy to do. It's more important that you do them well than that you do a lot of them. That's why it's a good idea to have a physical therapist check to be sure you have learned to use the right muscles and breathe normally while you do the exercises.\\n\\nWhen you do any core stability exercise, it's important to make sure:\\n\\nYou are breathing right. When you exercise, you should mostly breathe with your diaphragm, the large muscle that helps move air in and out of your lungs. To learn to breathe with your diaphragm: Lie on your back, or prop yourself up on several pillows. Put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. When you breathe in, push your belly out as far as possible. You should feel the hand on your belly move out, while the hand on your chest does not move. When you breathe out, you should feel the hand on your belly move in. Notice how it feels to breathe this way. When you start to exercise, try to get the same feeling of your chest and belly moving in and out as you breathe, rather than your chest and shoulders moving up toward your neck and back down. You find your neutral spine. Neutral spine is the name for posture that maintains the three normal curves in your spine—one in your neck, one in your upper back, and one in your lower back. Your spine should be in this neutral position when you do core stability exercises. It may seem more relaxing to let yourself slump down. But when you lose the normal curves of a neutral spine, you actually put more stress on your body. To find your neutral spine: Stand in front of a mirror with your hands on your hips. Allow your low back to arch so your stomach juts forward, and your buttocks stick out. Notice how your hands rotate forward. Tighten the muscles around your stomach and buttocks so your low back becomes very flat.\\n\\nNotice how your hands rotate backward. Now go halfway between the forward and back positions. Keeping your pelvis in this neutral position, stand tall with your ears and shoulders lined up over your hips. Practice finding this neutral spine in three positions: standing, sitting, and lying on your back with your knees bent. When you can do that, you can maintain good posture for daily activities and for exercise. Two simple exercises to try Pulling your belly in\\n\\nYou can do this exercise anywhere, in any position. Try it while you work at your desk, drive, or stand waiting for your turn at the drugstore.\\n\\nPull in your belly and imagine pulling your belly button back toward your spine. Remember to keep your neutral spine while you do this—don't let your back bend forward. Hold this for about 6 seconds. Remember to keep breathing normally. Rest for up to 10 seconds. Repeat 8 to 12 times. Floor bridge\\n\\nThe bridging exercise works the muscles around your lower body and hips. Do not continue with this exercise if it causes pain.\", 'The bridging exercise works the muscles around your lower body and hips. Do not continue with this exercise if it causes pain.\\n\\nLie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Your knees should be bent about 90 degrees. Find your neutral spine position. You will hold it during the exercise. Tighten your belly muscles by pulling in your belly button toward your spine. Then push your heels into the floor, squeeze your buttocks, and lift your hips off the floor until your shoulders, hips, and knees are all in a straight line. Hold about 6 seconds. Remember to breathe normally. Lower yourself slowly to the floor and rest for up to 10 seconds. Repeat 8 to 12 times. After you have mastered these simple exercises, your physical therapist can help you find more challenging ways to work on your trunk muscles. For example, you might do some activities while standing up, then do the same activities while sitting on a large ball called a Swiss ball. The ball makes it harder for you to keep your balance as you do the activity.', 'Sickle Cell Disease Sickle Cell Disease Sickled red blood cells Spleen Carrier Test for Autosomal Recessive Conditions Topic Overview What is sickle cell disease? Sickle cell disease changes normal, round red blood cells into cells that can be shaped like crescent moons. The name \"sickle cell\" comes from the crescent shape of the cells. (A sickle is a tool with a crescent-shaped blade.)\\n\\nNormal red blood cells move easily through your blood vessels, taking oxygen to every part of your body. But sickled cells can get stuck and block blood vessels, which stops the oxygen from getting through. That can cause a lot of pain. It can also harm organs, muscles, and bones.\\n\\nSee a picture of sickle cells blocking a blood vessel.\\n\\nHaving sickle cell disease means a lifelong battle against the health problems it can cause, such as pain, infections, anemia, and stroke. But many people are able to have a very good quality of life by learning to manage the disease.\\n\\nWhat causes sickle cell disease? Sickle cell disease is inherited, which means it is passed from parent to child. To get sickle cell disease, a child has to inherit two sickle cell genes—one from each parent.\\n\\nWhen a child inherits the gene from just one parent, that child has sickle cell trait. Having this trait means that you don\\'t have the disease but you are a carrier and could pass the gene on to your children.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? Painful events (sickle cell crises) are the most common symptom of sickle cell disease. They are periods of pain that happen when sickled cells get stuck in blood vessels and block the blood flow. These events usually cause pain in the hands, feet, belly, back, or chest. The pain may last for hours or for days.\\n\\nPeople with sickle cell disease often have anemia, caused by a shortage of red blood cells. Anemia makes you feel weak and tired. People with sickle cell anemia may look pale or washed out. Their skin and the whites of their eyes may have a yellowish look (jaundice).\\n\\nHow is sickle cell disease diagnosed? A simple blood test can show whether a person has sickle cell disease. Most states test for sickle cell disease before infants go home from the hospital.\\n\\nHow is it treated? Self-care and medical treatment can help you manage pain and avoid other health problems.\\n\\nEarly treatment includes daily antibiotics from 2 months to 5 years of age to help prevent infections. Routine childhood and adult immunizations are also important.\\n\\nManaging pain is often a big part of having sickle cell disease. You can prepare for a painful event ahead of time by creating a pain management plan with your doctor. The plan should include what you can do at home to relieve pain for yourself or your child. The plan should also tell you when it is best to call a doctor or go to a hospital.\\n\\nSome people need regular blood transfusions to lower the risk of stroke and treat anemia and other problems. Some people take medicine to prevent complications. In rare cases, a stem cell transplant might be an option.\\n\\nRegular checkups are an important part of life with this disease. People with sickle cell disease need a good working relationship with a doctor who is an expert in treating it.\\n\\nHow do you manage life with sickle cell disease? Tips for you\\n\\nLearn what triggers, or sets off, painful events called sickle cell crises. Triggers often include cold temperatures, wind, dehydration, and too much exercise. Low oxygen caused by cigarette smoke, high altitude, and plane flights is another common trigger. People with sickle cell disease and their families face ongoing stress. A support network can help ease stress and worry. Ask your doctor if there is a support group in your area. Tips for helping your child', \"Make sure that your child takes antibiotics regularly until age 5 to prevent infections. And make sure he or she receives all the usual immunizations on schedule. Your child can take part in normal school activities. Make sure that teachers understand your child's special needs, like needing frequent drinks and bathroom trips and avoiding overexertion and cold temperatures.\", \"Headaches: Managing a Headache Introduction You can reduce how many headaches you get and how bad they are when you do get them.

Tension Headache Triggers Migraine Headache Triggers Carry your medicine with you so you can treat a headache right away when you feel one starting. This is especially important if you get migraines. Don't take over-the-counter pain relievers more than 3 times a week, because you may get rebound headaches. These headaches usually occur after pain medicine has worn off. This prompts you to take another dose. After a while, you get a headache whenever you stop taking the medicine. Take drugs that cause the fewest side effects, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (for example, aspirin and ibuprofen). Exercise regularly, eat well, and reduce stress. Work with your doctor to find the best treatment for your headaches.\\n\\nHow do you manage a headache? Stopping headaches You can try several things to stop a headache after it starts:\\n\\nStop what you are doing, and begin treatment. Don't wait for the headache to get worse. Apply a cold, moist cloth or ice pack to your forehead and temples. Rest in a quiet, comfortable, dark room. Take your medicines exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Begin stress-relief methods as soon as your headache starts. Have a massage to relax tense muscles in your head, neck, temples, face, or jaw. Preventing headaches You can do things every day to help prevent headaches:\\n\\nFind and avoid your headache triggers by using a headache diary [PDF] . Sit and stand with good posture to avoid muscle tension. Live a healthy lifestyle.

Healthy eating starts with learning new ways to eat, such as adding more fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and cutting back on foods that have a lot of fat, salt, and sugar.\\n\\nA change to healthier eating also includes learning about balance, variety, and moderation.\\n\\nAim for balance. Most days, eat from each food group—grains, protein foods, vegetables and fruits, and dairy. Listen to your body. Eat when you're hungry. Stop when you feel satisfied. Look for variety. Be adventurous. Choose different foods in each food group. For example, don't reach for an apple every time you choose a fruit. Eating a variety of foods each day will help you get all the nutrients you need. Practice moderation. Don't have too much or too little of one thing. All foods, if eaten in moderation, can be part of healthy eating. Even sweets can be okay. Why pay attention to what you eat? Healthy eating will help you get the right balance of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. It will help you feel your best and have plenty of energy. It can help you handle stress better.\\n\\nHealthy eating is one of the best things you can do to prevent and control many health problems, such as:\\n\\nHeart disease. High blood pressure. Type 2 diabetes. Some types of cancer. Is healthy eating the same as going on a diet? Healthy eating is not a diet. It means making changes you can live with and enjoy for the rest of your life.\\n\\nDiets are temporary. Because you give up so much when you diet, you may be hungry and think about food all the time. And after you stop dieting, you also may overeat to make up for what you missed.\\n\\nEating a healthy, balanced variety of foods is far more satisfying. And if you match that with more physical activity, you are more likely to get to a healthy weight—and stay there—than if you diet.\\n\\nHow do you make healthy eating a habit? First, think about your reasons for healthier eating. Do you want to improve your health? Do you want to feel better? Are you trying to set an example for your kids?\\n\\nNext, think about some small changes you can make. Pick ones you can keep doing.\\n\\nDon't try to change everything at once. Set an easy goal you can reach, like having a salad and a piece of fruit each day. Make a long-term goal too, such as having one vegetarian dinner a week. Where can you get support? Having support from others can be a huge help. The more support you have, the easier it will be to make changes. Ask family and friends to practice healthy eating with you. Have them help you make meals, and share healthy, delicious recipes and cooking tips.\\n\\nIf you need more help, talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian.

It\\'s normal for blood pressure to go up and down throughout the day. But if it stays up, you have high blood pressure. Another name for high blood pressure is hypertension.\\n\\nHigh blood pressure increases the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other problems. You and your doctor will talk about your risks of these problems based on your blood pressure.\\n\\nYour doctor will give you a goal for your blood pressure. Your goal will be based on your health and your age.\\n\\nYour blood pressure consists of two numbers: systolic and diastolic. Someone with a systolic pressure of 120 and a diastolic pressure of 80 has a blood pressure of 120/80, or \"120 over 80.\" Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).\\n\\nThe systolic number shows how hard the blood pushes when the heart is pumping. The diastolic number shows how hard the blood pushes between heartbeats, when the heart is relaxed and filling with blood. What causes high blood pressure? In most cases, doctors can\\'t point to the exact cause. But several things are known to raise blood pressure, including being very overweight, drinking too much alcohol, having a family history of high blood pressure, eating too much salt, and getting older.\\n\\nYour blood pressure may also rise if you are not very active, you don\\'t eat enough potassium and calcium, or you have a condition called insulin resistance.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms?

Hypothyroidism means your thyroid is not making enough thyroid hormone. If you are looking for information about when the thyroid makes too much thyroid hormone, see the topic Hyperthyroidism.\\n\\nWhat is hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism means your thyroid is not making enough thyroid hormone. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way your body uses energy.\\n\\nHaving a low level of thyroid hormone affects your whole body. It can make you feel tired and weak. If hypothyroidism is not treated, it can raise your cholesterol levels. During pregnancy, untreated hypothyroidism can harm your baby. But hypothyroidism can be treated with medicine that can help you feel like yourself again.\\n\\nPeople of any age can get hypothyroidism, but older adults are more likely to get it. Women age 60 and older have the highest risk. You are more likely to get the disease if it runs in your family.\\n\\nWhat causes hypothyroidism? In the United States, the most common cause is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It causes the body's immune system to attack thyroid tissue. As a result, the gland can't make enough thyroid hormone.\\n\\nOther things that can lead to low levels of thyroid hormone include surgery to remove the thyroid gland and radiation therapy for cancer. Less common causes include viral infections and some drugs, such as amiodarone and lithium.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? Hypothyroidism can cause many different symptoms, such as:\\n\\nFeeling tired, weak, or depressed. Dry skin and brittle nails. Not being able to stand the cold. Constipation. Memory problems or having trouble thinking clearly. Heavy or irregular menstrual periods. Symptoms occur slowly over time. At first you might not notice them, or you might mistake them for normal aging. See your doctor if you have symptoms like these that get worse or won't go away.\\n\\nHow is hypothyroidism diagnosed? Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms. You will also have a physical exam. If your doctor thinks you have hypothyroidism, a simple blood test can show if your thyroid hormone level is too low.\\n\\nHow is it treated? Doctors usually prescribe pills to treat hypothyroidism. Most people start to feel better in a week or two. Your symptoms will probably go away within a few months. But you will likely need to keep taking the pills from now on.\\n\\nIt's important to take your medicine just the way your doctor tells you to. You will also need to see your doctor for follow-up visits to make sure you have the right dose. Getting too much or too little thyroid hormone can cause problems.\\n\\nIf you have mild hypothyroidism, you may not need treatment now. But you'll want to watch for signs that it is getting worse.\\n\\nIf you are diagnosed with severe hypothyroidism, you will need to be treated right away in the hospital. Severe hypothyroidism can lead to a rare but dangerous disease called myxedema coma.\\n\\nCause In the United States, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This is a condition that causes the body's natural defenses—the immune system—to produce antibodies that over time destroy thyroid tissue. As a result, the thyroid gland cannot make enough thyroid hormone.\\n\\nWorldwide, iodine deficiency is the number one cause of hypothyroidism. But iodine added to salt, food, and water has nearly eliminated this problem in the U.S. and other Western countries.\\n\\nOther common causes of hypothyroidism include:\", 'Other common causes of hypothyroidism include:\\n\\nThyroid surgery. Part or all of the thyroid gland may be removed to treat disorders such as having too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism), an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) that makes swallowing difficult, thyroid cancer, or thyroid nodules that may be overactive or cancerous. Hypothyroidism results when the thyroid gland is removed or when remaining thyroid tissue does not function properly. Radioactive iodine therapy, which is often used to treat hyperthyroidism. Radioactive iodine therapy can destroy the thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism. External beam radiation, which is used to treat some cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma. This radiation treatment can destroy the thyroid gland. Less common causes include:\\n\\nInfections. Viral and bacterial infections can temporarily damage the thyroid gland. This causes a short-term form of the condition. Hypothyroidism caused by infection usually does not result in permanent hypothyroidism. Medicines. Some medicines can interfere with normal production of thyroid hormone. Lithium is one of the most common medicines that causes hypothyroidism. Others include amiodarone and interferon alfa (such as Intron A or Roferon A). In rare cases, disorders of the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus (secondary and tertiary forms of hypothyroidism). The pituitary gland and hypothalamus produce hormones that control the thyroid and, as a result, affect its ability to produce thyroid hormone. Excessive iodine, which, in food or medicines, can reduce the function of the thyroid gland. This is usually temporary. Congenital hypothyroidism. In rare cases, an infant is born without a properly functioning thyroid gland. All children born in a hospital in the U.S. are tested at birth for hypothyroidism.', \"Ear Infection: Should I Give My Child Antibiotics? You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them.\\n\\nEar Infection: Should I Give My Child Antibiotics?\\n\\nGet the facts Your options Wait and see if the ear infection clears up on its own. Give your child antibiotics. Key points to remember This topic is only appropriate for children 6 months and older. Most ear infections clear up on their own. Antibiotics do not help with ear pain immediately. You can treat pain at home with pain relievers and by putting a warm washcloth on your child's ear. If your child is age 6 months or older and has a mild earache, you can wait for up to 48 hours to see if the infection gets better on its own. Talk to your doctor if your child's pain doesn't get better with an over-the-counter pain reliever (such as acetaminophen) or if other symptoms last for more than 48 hours. Doctors usually prescribe antibiotics if a child:footnote1 Is younger than 2 and has an infection in both ears or has more than mild pain or fever. Is very ill from the infection. For example, your child may be dehydrated. Has other health problems, such as cleft palate or repeat infections that could put him or her at risk for serious problems from an ear infection. Has cochlear implants. If your doctor prescribes antibiotics, you may have to wait at least another 48 hours for the medicine to take effect. Antibiotics can have side effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and an allergic reaction. Taking antibiotics when they're not needed can make it hard for these medicines to work the next time your child needs them.\\n\\nThis can happen because bacteria can build up resistance to the medicine. FAQs What is a middle ear infection? A middle ear infection, also called otitis media, is inflammation or infection of the middle ear. Ear infections often occur along with a cold or other upper respiratory infections. Almost all children have at least one ear infection before age 7.\\n\\nMost ear infections are caused by bacteria. But viruses also can cause them. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the influenza (flu) virus are the two main viruses that cause ear infections.\\n\\nEar infections are most common in young children, because young children have shorter eustachian tubes, which are more easily blocked than those of older children and adults. When the tube is blocked, fluid builds up. This creates a breeding ground for germs.\\n\\nPus forms as the body tries to fight the infection. More fluid collects and pushes against the eardrum, causing pain and sometimes a temporary loss of hearing. Fever lasts about 1 to 2 days. Most children have some pain on and off for up to 4 days. Young children may have pain that comes and goes for up to 9 days. How can you tell if your child has an ear infection? If your child has an ear infection, he or she may:\\n\\nHave an earache. It may be mild, or it may hurt a lot. Act fussy (babies or young children) or grumpy. Pull at his or her ears. Have trouble sleeping. Have trouble hearing. Have a fever. Not feel like eating. Vomit. Most parents will know that these symptoms point to an ear infection after their children have had a couple of ear infections. But a visit to the doctor is the only way to know for sure. Your child's doctor can diagnose an infection by looking at your child's ears with a tool called an otoscope. How well do antibiotics clear up ear infections? Antibiotics work most of the time to treat ear infections caused by bacteria. But they won't treat ear infections caused by viruses.\\n\\nNo matter what causes the infection, most children 6 months and older won't need antibiotics. Up to 80 out of 100 ear infections get better on their own, while 20 out of 100 don't. How can you treat your child's ear infection at home? You can help ease your child's pain at home, whether you use antibiotics or wait for the ear infection to get better on its own.\\n\\nYou can:\", \"You can:\\n\\nGive your child an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin).

Aspirin has been linked to Reye syndrome, a serious illness.\\n\\nPut a warm washcloth on the ear. Help your child rest by arranging quiet play. Give your child eardrops for pain if your doctor prescribes them. Why might your doctor recommend antibiotics for an ear infection?\\n\\nDoctors usually prescribe antibiotics if a child:\\n\\nIs younger than 6 months, because infections at this age are less likely to go away during watchful waiting.

Children who have these hearing devices are at risk for more serious infection.\", \"Panic Attacks and Panic Disorder Topic Overview What are panic attacks and panic disorder? A panic attack is a sudden, intense fear or anxiety that may make you short of breath or dizzy or make your heart pound. You may feel out of control. Some people believe that they are having a heart attack or are about to die. An attack usually lasts from 5 to 20 minutes. But it may last even longer, up to a few hours. You have the most anxiety about 10 minutes after the attack starts. If these attacks happen often, they are called a panic disorder.\\n\\nPanic attacks can be scary and so bad that they get in the way of your daily activities. Treatment can help most people have fewer symptoms or even stop the attacks.\\n\\nMore women than men get panic attacks.\\n\\nWhat causes panic attacks and panic disorder? Experts aren't sure what causes panic attacks and panic disorder. But the body has a natural response when you are stressed or in danger. It speeds up your heart, makes you breathe faster, and gives you a burst of energy. This is called the fight-or-flight response. It gets you ready to either cope with or run away from danger. A panic attack occurs when this response happens when there is no danger.\\n\\nSome people are more sensitive to anxiety and panic than others. Panic attacks and panic disorder may be more likely if you have a family history of panic disorder. They sometimes happen with no clear cause.\\n\\nPanic attacks may also be brought on by:\\n\\nA health problem such as an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), or heart or breathing problems. Depression or another mood disorder. Heavy alcohol use. Using too much nicotine or too much caffeine. Taking certain medicines, such as those used to treat asthma and heart problems. Drug use. Living with high levels of stress for a long time. You have a higher chance of getting panic disorder if you have a parent with depression or bipolar disorder.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? Symptoms of a panic attack may include:\\n\\nA feeling of intense fear, terror, or anxiety. Trouble breathing or very fast breathing. Chest pain or tightness. A heartbeat that races or isn't regular. Sweating. Nausea or an upset stomach. Dizziness and shaking. Numbness or tingling. Symptoms of panic disorder may include:\\n\\nRepeated panic attacks when there is no reason for the fight-or-flight response. Changing your daily activities because you worry that you will have another attack. Some people have a fear of being in crowds, standing in line, or going into shopping malls. They are afraid of having another panic attack or of not being able to escape. This problem is called agoraphobia. It can be so bad for some people that they never leave their homes.\\n\\nPeople who have panic disorder often have depression at the same time.\\n\\nHow are panic attacks and panic disorder diagnosed? Your doctor will ask about your past health and do a physical exam. The exam may include listening to your heart, checking your blood pressure, and ordering blood tests to look for other causes of your problem.\\n\\nHow are they treated? Treatment for panic attacks and panic disorder includes counseling, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Medicines may also help. Treatment can help most people control or even stop attacks. But symptoms can come back, especially if you stop treatment too soon.\\n\\nEarly treatment of panic attacks is very important. It can prevent other problems related to panic disorder. These problems include depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorder.\", \"Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) Temporomandibular (TM) joint Temporomandibular disorder (TMD): Areas of pain Condition Basics What are temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) is the name given to several problems with jaw movement and pain in and around the jaw joints. They cause pain when you talk, chew, swallow, or yawn.\\n\\nYou may also hear TMDs called TMJ or TM problems.\\n\\nThe jaw joints, or temporomandibular (TM) joints, connect the lower jawbone (mandible) to the skull. These flexible joints are used more than any other joint in the body. They allow the jaw to open and close for talking, chewing, swallowing, yawning, and other movements.\\n\\nWhat causes them? TMDs are caused by muscle tension, often triggered by stress. Clenching or grinding your teeth can tire the jaw muscles, leading to muscle spasms, tissue damage, pain, and sore muscles. A TMD can also start with an injury to the jaw joint or a joint disease like osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? TMDs can affect the jaw and jaw joint as well as muscles in the face, shoulder, head, and neck. Common symptoms include joint pain, muscle pain, headaches, joint sounds, trouble with fully opening the mouth, and jaw locking.\\n\\nHow are they diagnosed? There is no one way to diagnose a TMD. Your doctor can check your condition with a physical exam and by asking questions about your health. In some cases, an X-ray, CT scan, or MRI is also used to check for bone or soft tissue problems related to symptoms of a TMD.\\n\\nHow are TMDs treated? The focus of TMD treatment is to ease pain in the jaw joint and restore normal jaw movement. Initial treatment involves over-the-counter pain medicine and self-care at home. Splints can help reduce teeth grinding and clenching. Your doctor may suggest other treatments as well. Surgery isn't usually done to treat TMDs.\", \"Immunizations: Questions Parents Ask Common Questions What are immunizations? Immunizations help keep you and your child from getting a disease. They contain medicine that causes the body to make antibodies. These antibodies can then recognize and fight the disease if you or your child is later exposed to it.\\n\\nImmunizations are also called vaccines or vaccinations.\\n\\nWhy should my child get immunized? Vaccines:\\n\\nHelp prevent you or your child from getting dangerous diseases for which there are often no medical treatments. Help keep disease from spreading. Help protect people with weak immune systems, who may not be able to get vaccines. Their only protection is for others to get vaccinated so illnesses are less common. Cost less than getting treated for the diseases. Have very few serious side effects. Often are needed before a child can attend school or day care. Prevent days out of work or school due to illness or caring for a sick person. Vaccines are the best way we have to prevent infectious diseases. A successful vaccine program depends on everyone getting vaccinated.\\n\\nWhen should my child be immunized? Ask your doctor what shots your child should get. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) keeps a list of shots needed for each age group.\\n\\nWhy do I have to use the government schedule? Can't I use my own schedule?\\n\\nThe schedule recommended by experts is designed to work best with a child's immune system at certain ages and at certain times. The schedule is set up so that your child gets the best protection possible at the earliest age possible from the fewest shots possible.\\n\\nExperts review the schedules every year based on the best research available and change the schedules as needed.\\n\\nA different schedule may not provide protection for your child. If shots are spread out or skipped, a child may get the disease during the delay.\\n\\nWhy does my child need so many doses to protect against one disease? Your child gets as many shots as needed to give him or her full protection from a disease. This may be one shot only, or it may be several doses.\\n\\nMore than one dose may be needed because immunity may have to build up over time. You want the best combination of immediate and future protection for your child. This means that your child needs a certain amount of vaccine spaced apart at different ages. This builds the best protection.\\n\\nDon't babies get natural protection from the mother? During the last few weeks of pregnancy, mothers give their babies some protection against disease. But it is only for diseases that the mother is protected against. The protection the baby gets does not last long.\\n\\nHaven't we gotten rid of most diseases children are immunized for? Vaccinations in the United States have led to a sharp drop in diseases. Better living conditions have also helped, but they aren't enough to protect you from disease.\\n\\nRemember that a vaccine gives your child protection from the disease. A vaccine does not get rid of the disease. The disease still exists, and if fewer children get immunized for a disease, the disease could come back.\\n\\nAnd some diseases no longer found in the U.S., such as polio, still exist in other countries. People who travel or move to the U.S. can bring these diseases into the country. So it's still very important to have your child immunized.\\n\\nIs it okay to skip a shot when my child is sick? On very rare occasions, your doctor may suggest waiting to have your child immunized. For example, you may need to wait when your child has:\\n\\nA history of serious allergic reaction to a vaccine. Severe vomiting or diarrhea, when dehydration is a concern. A serious illness, such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis, or a severe asthma attack. But children usually can still get a shot even when they have a minor illness. This includes a cold or an ear infection. And children usually can still get a shot when they are taking antibiotics.\\n\\nTalk to your doctor if you have any concerns about having your child immunized.\", \"Pregnancy\\n\\nNormal pregnancy: First trimester Normal pregnancy: Second trimester Normal pregnancy: Third trimester Topic Overview Is this topic for you? This topic covers pregnancy information, including planning for labor and delivery. If you aren't pregnant yet, see the topic Preparing for a Healthy Pregnancy. For more information on labor and delivery, see the topic Labor and Delivery.\\n\\nWhat can you do to have a healthy pregnancy? You may be happy and excited to find out that you're pregnant. And you may be a little nervous or worried. If this will be your first child, you may even feel overwhelmed by all of the things you need to know about having a baby. There is a lot to learn. But you don't have to know everything right away. You can read all about pregnancy now, or you can learn about each stage as your pregnancy goes on.\\n\\nPregnancy is measured in trimesters from the first day of your last menstrual period, totaling 40 weeks. Most babies are born at 37 to 42 weeks.\\n\\nDuring your pregnancy, you'll have tests to watch for certain problems that could occur. With all the tests you'll have, you may worry that something will go wrong. But most women have healthy pregnancies. If there is a problem, these tests can find it early so that you and your doctor or midwife can treat it or watch it to help improve your chance of having a healthy baby.\\n\\nTaking great care of yourself is the best thing you can do for yourself and your baby. Everything healthy that you do for your body helps your growing baby. Rest when you need it, eat well, and exercise regularly. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after you are active. This is very important when it's hot out.\\n\\nYou'll need to have regular checkups. At every visit, your doctor or midwife will weigh you and measure your belly to check your baby's growth. You'll also get blood and urine tests and have your blood pressure checked.\\n\\nIt's important to avoid tobacco smoke, alcohol and drugs, chemicals, and radiation (like X-rays). These can harm you and the baby.\\n\\nWhat kinds of exams and tests will you have? Your first prenatal exam gives your doctor or midwife important information for planning your care. You'll have a pelvic exam and urine and blood tests. You'll also have your blood pressure and weight checked. The urine and blood tests are used for a pregnancy test and to tell whether you have low iron levels (are anemic) or have signs of infection.\\n\\nAt each prenatal visit you'll be weighed, have your belly measured, and have your blood pressure and urine checked. Go to all your appointments. Although these quick office visits may seem simple and routine, your doctor is watching for signs of possible problems like high blood pressure.\\n\\nIn some medical centers, you can have screening in your first trimester to see if your baby has a chance of having Down syndrome or another genetic problem. The test usually includes a blood test and an ultrasound.\\n\\nDuring your second trimester, you can have a blood test (triple or quadruple screen test) to see if you have a higher-than-normal chance of having a baby with birth defects. Based on the results of the tests, you may be referred to a geneticist for further discussion. Or you may have other tests to find out for sure if your baby has a birth defect.\\n\\nLate in your second trimester, your blood sugar will be checked for diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes). Near the end of your pregnancy, you will have tests to look for infections that could harm your newborn.\\n\\nWhat changes can you expect in your body and your emotions? You will go through some amazing changes during pregnancy. Your body, emotions, and relationships will all do some growing. These changes are common, but some may be a challenge.\\n\\nEvery woman feels these changes in her own way. Even the way she changes can change. In the beginning of your pregnancy, you may feel so tired that you can barely keep your head up. But at other times, you may have trouble sleeping.\", \"Many women feel nauseated in the morning (morning sickness) or at other times of day in the early part of pregnancy. But some women never have this problem. Your breasts will get larger and may feel tender. Throughout your pregnancy, you may get heartburn or crave certain foods, and you may have aches and pains. You also may enjoy the flutters of your baby moving and kicking.\\n\\nYour emotions may move around too. Even women who are happy about their pregnancy may worry a lot about their babies. They may even feel some sadness at the coming changes in their lifestyles.\\n\\nYour relationship with your partner and other children you may have also may change.

You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them.\\n\\nProstate Cancer Screening: Should I Have a PSA Test?\\n\\nGet the facts Your options Have a PSA blood test to check for prostate cancer. Do not have a PSA blood test to check for prostate cancer. This information is for men in their 50s and 60s. But it also may be helpful to other men who are thinking about this decision.\\n\\nKey points to remember PSA tests can help find some prostate cancers early, when the cancer may be easier to treat. The largest study of prostate cancer screening so far showed that PSA testing may prevent a small number of men from dying of prostate cancer. A high PSA level can have many causes, including an enlarged prostate, an infection, or, less often, prostate cancer. A high PSA can cause a lot of worry and lead to more tests. But most high PSA test results will not turn out to be from cancer. Many cancers found by PSA tests would not have caused a problem if they had not been found through screening. But when they are found, they often get treated with surgery to remove the prostate or with radiation. These cancer treatments may not have been needed. And they can have serious side effects, such as urinary, bowel, and erection problems. Many prostate cancers grow slowly. This means that many men with prostate cancer will die of something else before their prostate cancer advances enough to cause any problems. With faster-growing prostate cancers, finding the cancer early may not help you live longer. Some prostate cancers will be fatal no matter when they are found or how they are treated. FAQs What is prostate cancer? Prostate cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the tissues of the prostate gland. It is the second most common cancer in men. Most men who get it are older than 65.\\n\\nEarly prostate cancer usually doesn't cause symptoms. When prostate cancer is found before it has spread outside the prostate gland, a man's options include active surveillance, surgery to remove the prostate, or radiation. If a prostate cancer grows or spreads, symptoms may develop, including urinary problems (such as blood in the urine) and bone pain.\\n\\nMany prostate cancers grow slowly. This means that many men with prostate cancer will die of something else before their prostate cancer advances enough to cause any problems. With faster-growing prostate cancers, finding the cancer early may not help you live longer. Some prostate cancers will be fatal no matter when they're found or how they are treated.\\n\\nCompare your options Compare Have a PSA test Don't have a PSA test What is usually involved?\\n\\nYou have a blood test to check your PSA level. If your PSA is high, you'll need more tests. These may include repeat PSA tests or a prostate biopsy. Instead of having regular PSA tests, you see your doctor as needed or if you have prostate or urinary symptoms. What are the benefits?\\n\\nA PSA test can help find some prostate cancers early, when the cancer may be easier to treat. PSA testing may prevent a small number of men from dying of prostate cancer. You avoid testing that could lead to a diagnosis of cancer and treatments that can cause urinary, bowel, and erection problems. What are the risks and side effects?\", \"A PSA test may miss some cancers. Some PSA tests may be normal when there is cancer (called a false-negative). A PSA test may show a high level that is not caused by cancer (called a false-positive). If your PSA test is high, you may need more tests—like a prostate biopsy—to check for cancer. These tests can be harmful. For example, prostate biopsies can cause infections. For a few men, these infections are very serious. These tests can also cause a lot of worry. A PSA test may find cancers that would not have caused a problem (called overdiagnosis). This can lead to cancer treatments that you don't need. These treatments can cause urinary, bowel, and erection problems. You may miss the chance of finding prostate cancer early, when the cancer may be easier to treat. Personal stories about having a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test to screen for prostate cancer These stories are based on information gathered from health professionals and consumers. They may be helpful as you make important health decisions.\\n\\nFor me, there is still too much uncertainty about how helpful the PSA test is and how accurate it is. I've read that high PSAs can be caused by things other than cancer. But the only way to check for cancer is to have a biopsy. I don't want to have to go through that if I don't have to. And the fact that I might be treated for a cancer that wouldn't have caused a problem is troublesome. So for now, I'm not going to have the PSA test.\\n\\nMike, age 62\\n\\nI've done some reading on this subject, and I know that I'm a lot more likely to die from my heart disease than from prostate cancer. Right now I'm focusing my efforts on controlling my blood pressure and cholesterol because I know that treating those things can help me live longer and better. I know that if I had the PSA test and it was high, I would just worry and be stressed out.\\n\\nPieter, age 67\", \"Quitting Smoking Nicotine Patch Use Topic Overview Is this topic for you?

Are you Dealing With Relapse? Are you Trying to Quit Smokeless Tobacco? Are you ready to quit? Maybe you have already taken your last puff or are ready to quit today. That's great. This information will help you keep your resolve to kick the habit for good.\\n\\nOr maybe you want to plan ahead before you quit. How ready are you to quit? To find out, use the Interactive Tool: Are You Ready to Quit Smoking?\\n\\nIt's okay if you aren't ready now. But you may want to quit at some point. So keep learning and preparing yourself. Many smokers do quit. You can too.\\n\\nWhy do you want to quit? Think about why you want to quit. Maybe you want to protect your heart and your health and live longer. Or maybe you want to be a good role model for your kids or spend your money on something besides cigarettes. Your reason for wanting to change is important. If your reason comes from you—and not someone else—it will be easier for you to try to quit for good.\\n\\nFind out how smoking can affect you:\\n\\nHow Does Smoking Affect Your Lifespan? How can you quit? Quitting smoking is hard. Some people who have quit say that it was the hardest thing they have ever done. But most smokers eventually are able to quit smoking. And you don't have to do it alone. Ask your family, friends, and doctor to help you. Get what you need to help you quit for good.\\n\\nGet ready. If you're ready to quit right now, go ahead. Medicines and support can help you stay on track. But if you want to plan ahead, you don't have to stop right away. Set a date to quit. Pick a time when you won't have a lot of stress in your life. Think about cutting down on smoking before your quit date. You can try to decrease the number of cigarettes you smoke each day as a way to quit smoking. Get rid of ashtrays, lighters, or spit cups before you quit. Talk to your partner or friends about helping you stay smoke-free. Don't let people smoke in your house. Change your routine. For example, if you smoke after eating, take a walk instead. Use medicine. It can help with cravings and stress, and it doubles your chances of quitting smoking.footnote1 You can buy nicotine gum, lozenges, or patches without a prescription. Your doctor may also prescribe medicine, such as bupropion (Zyban) or varenicline (Chantix). If you take varenicline, you can stop smoking a little bit at a time, which may increase your chance of quitting. Get support. Seek help from: The national tobacco quitline: 1-800-QUIT NOW (1-800-784-8669). Free smartphone, tablet, or handheld computer apps, such as the National Cancer Institute's QuitPal. A text messaging program from www.smokefree.gov called SmokefreeTXT. Internet programs, such as www.smokefree.gov, which also have chat rooms. Doctors, nurses, or therapists for counseling. A friend who has quit smoking.\\n\\nAfter you quit, try not to smoke at all—not even one puff. Prevent a slip (smoking one or two cigarettes) or relapse (returning to regular smoking) by avoiding smoking triggers, at least at first. These triggers can include friends who smoke, alcohol, and stress. Don't keep cigarettes in your house or car. If you do slip, stay calm. Remind yourself that you have a plan, and think about how hard you've worked to quit for good.\\n\\nWhy is it so hard to quit? Quitting is hard because your body depends on the nicotine in tobacco. Giving it up is more than just kicking a bad habit. Your body has to stop craving the nicotine. Nicotine gum, lozenges, patches, and other medicines can help reduce the cravings without the harmful effects of smoking.\", \"You also have to change your habits. You may not even think about smoking. You just do it. You may not realize it, but seeing someone smoke—or just seeing cigarettes—may cause you to want to smoke. You may smoke when you drink alcohol or when you are stressed. Or maybe you have a cigarette with coffee. Before you quit, think of new ways to handle these things. For example, call a friend or practice deep breathing when you feel stressed. Try chewing sugarless gum instead of smoking. Go for a walk when you have a break at work. When you first start your quit, it's okay to stay around nonsmokers. And it's okay to avoid situations where you may be tempted to smoke (like occasions where alcohol will be served) until you feel more confident about staying smoke-free.\\n\\nWhat if you feel bad when you are trying to quit? You are likely to crave cigarettes and to have withdrawal symptoms. You may feel grouchy or restless or you may have a hard time concentrating for the first 2 to 3 weeks after you quit. It may be hard to focus on tasks. Or you may have trouble sleeping and want to eat more. But you won't feel bad forever, and medicine can help. Using medicines and products like nicotine gum or patches can help with cravings and make it easier to resist smoking.\\n\\nWill you gain weight? You may worry about gaining weight after you stop smoking. This is understandable. In fact, many smokers do gain weight during their quit attempt. In your plan to quit smoking, include eating healthy snacks and doing some physical activity to help you avoid weight gain during your quit.\\n\\nIf you do gain weight, you can focus on losing it after you have successfully quit smoking. Be patient with yourself and try to tackle one change at a time.\\n\\nYou can take steps to lower your chance of gaining weight:\\n\\nTry to be active. Exercise can also improve your mood and reduce your craving for a cigarette. If you haven't been getting much exercise, start walking every day, gradually increasing how far you walk. Or take a beginning yoga class. If you are already active, see about joining others for a sport you enjoy, such as biking, hiking, or playing volleyball. Eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and eat fewer high-fat foods. Cutting back on food (dieting) can make quitting smoking harder. Try not to substitute food for cigarettes. Instead, chew gum, or chew on a drinking straw or a coffee stirrer. Use quit-smoking medicines or nicotine replacement. They may make gaining weight less likely while you are quitting smoking.\\n\\nWhat if you start smoking again? Most people quit and restart many times before they stop smoking for good. If you start smoking again after you quit, don't give up. If you return to smoking, but smoke less than before, try to keep your smoking at that lower level so it will be easier to quit in the future. Also, if you are ready to try to quit again soon, do so. You do not need to wait to try again. Each time you quit, even if it is just for a short time, you get closer to your long-term goal.\\n\\nRemind yourself that by quitting you may avoid serious health problems and live longer. Remember your reasons for quitting. Maybe you want to protect your heart and your health and live longer.\\n\\nEach time you quit, you learn more about what helps and what gets in the way. Think about why you started smoking again and about what you will do differently next time. If you tried to quit without medicines or counseling, think about trying them next time. If you did use a medicine and counseling, think about trying a different type next time, or think about changing other things in your life, like travel routines and recreation. Medicines and nicotine replacement (gum, patches, lozenges) can double your chances of success.footnote1 And using medicines and counseling is even more effective. You can do it!\", \"Healthy Aging Body Fat Distribution Topic Overview What is healthy aging? Getting older is a natural part of life. How you will feel as you get older depends on many things, including what health problems run in your family and the choices you make. If you take good care of your body and learn positive ways to deal with stress now, you can slow down or even prevent problems that often come with getting older.\\n\\nIt's never too early or too late to change bad habits and start good ones. No matter when you start, a healthy lifestyle can make a difference in how you feel and what you can do.\\n\\nWhat determines how healthy you will be as you get older? The changes you'll go through as you get older depend on a number of things. One is your family history (genetics). If your family members have diseases or ongoing (chronic) health problems like high blood pressure or diabetes, then you may have a greater chance of having those problems yourself. But just because your risk is higher, it doesn't mean you will definitely have the same problems. In fact, the lifestyle choices you make can help reduce your chances of getting illnesses that run in your family. And even if you do get a family illness, choosing to be physically active, to eat healthy foods, and to learn how to deal with stress can keep the illness from destroying your ability to enjoy your golden years.\\n\\nWhat kinds of changes should you expect as you age? Changes as you get older are usually gradual. Certain physical changes are common. Your metabolism (how fast your body can burn calories) slows over time, which means that your body needs less food energy than before. How much and how well you sleep will likely change. Most people start needing reading glasses around age 40, and many have some hearing loss later in life. Starting in your 50s, bone aging increases. Also starting around age 50, you may notice changes in sexual function—it's normal to have a slower sexual response.\\n\\nMost vital organs gradually become less efficient with age. The kidneys are less able to keep enough water in your body. And the heart can start to show signs of wear and tear. So as you get older, it's important to be physically active, drink plenty of water, and choose healthy foods. Doing these things will help your body work well for a longer period of time.\\n\\nWhat do you need to do to feel your best as you age? One of the most important things you can do for your health at any age is to be physically active. Physical activity keeps your body strong, and it helps with how you feel. People who stay active are less likely to get depressed. Physical activity can be anything from walking to gardening to working out at the gym. The important thing is to be active almost every day. No matter what your age or condition, there is a type of physical activity that's right for you. Always ask your doctor whether it is safe for you to start a physical activity program.\\n\\nYour mental and emotional health are also important. Protect or improve your emotional health by staying in touch with friends, family, and the community. People who feel connected to others are more likely to thrive than those who do not. And try to keep stress at a minimum. In addition to getting regular physical activity, you can take charge of how stress affects you by taking 20 minutes a day to just relax.\\n\\nTo protect or improve your memory and mental sharpness, keep your brain active and challenged. Learn or do something new and different. For example, attend an educational workshop or learn a new card game. Depression can be a serious problem for older adults. If you think you may be depressed, seek help—antidepressant medicine and counseling can help treat depression.\\n\\nOther good health habits can help you stay at your best:\\n\\nEat a healthy, balanced diet. Avoid salty foods and foods with a lot of fat in them, such as fried foods. Remember that sexually transmitted infections can affect anyone at any age, so practicing safer sex is a must. If you smoke, try to quit. Always wear your seat belt. Don't abuse alcohol or drugs.\", \"714-X (PDQ®): Integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies - Patient Information [NCI] This information is produced and provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The information in this topic may have changed since it was written. For the most current information, contact the National Cancer Institute via the Internet web site at http://cancer.gov or call 1-800-4-CANCER.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nQuestions and Answers About 714-X What is 714-X? The main ingredient in 714-X is made by combining chemicals with camphor, a natural substance that comes from the wood and bark of the camphor tree. Ammonia and salt are added to camphor to make 714-X.\\n\\nWhat is the history of the discovery and use of 714-X as a complementary and alternative treatment for cancer? 714-X was developed in the 1960s in Canada, where it is still being made. Patients in Canada can get 714-X only from a doctor, for compassionate use (giving a treatment to patients before it is approved, because they have a life-threatening disease and there is no drug or other therapy to treat the disease). 714-X is used in Mexico and some western European countries. It is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States (see Question 8).\\n\\nWhat is the theory behind the claim that 714-X is useful in treating cancer? The development of 714-X was based on the theory that there are tiny living things in the blood called somatids. According to this theory, some types of somatids are found only in the blood of people who have cancer or other serious diseases. These types of somatids are said to make growth hormones that cause cells to grow without control. The makers of 714-X state that by looking at the number and type of somatids in the blood, doctors can see if cancer is starting to form or can diagnose cancer and predict where the cancer will spread.\\n\\nThe theory states that cancer cells trap nitrogen needed by normal cells and make a toxic substance that weakens the immune system. 714-X is reported to help the body fight cancer cells in these ways:\\n\\nThe camphor in 714-X is said to prevent cancer cells from taking nitrogen from the body's normal cells. 714-X is also said to help the immune system by increasing the flow of lymph, the colorless fluid that travels through the body carrying white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Some research studies are published in scientific journals. Most scientific journals have experts who review research reports before they are published, to make sure that the evidence and conclusions are sound. This is called peer review. Studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals are considered to be better evidence. No studies have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals to support the theory of somatids in the development of cancer. Research on the use of 714-X as a cancer treatment is discussed in Question 5 and Question 6.\\n\\nHow is 714-X administered? 714-X is usually given by injection near the lymph nodes in the groin. In some patients with lung or oral cancer, 714-X can be sprayed into the nose using a nebulizer (a device that turns liquid into a fine spray). The makers of 714-X do not recommend injecting it into a vein (intravenously) or taking it by mouth.\\n\\nThe makers of 714\\n\\nX suggest the following:\\n\\n714-X is more effective if given early in the disease, before chemotherapy or radiation therapy is begun. 714-X can be used along with conventional treatments. Vitamin B 12 supplements, vitamin E supplements, shark cartilage, and alcohol should not be used during treatment with 714-X. Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using 714-X? Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a drug, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. Animal tumor models are used to learn how a cancer may progress and to test new treatments. These preclinical studies are done before any testing in humans is begun.\", 'No laboratory studies of the safety and/or effectiveness of 714-X have been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. A few animal experiments have been done, but the results of these experiments have not been reported in scientific journals. The animal studies used a lymphosarcoma tumor model in rats and lymphoma tumor models in dogs and cows. 714-X was not found to be effective against cancer in these studies.\\n\\nHave any clinical trials (research studies with people) of 714-X been conducted? No clinical trials or other studies with cancer patients have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals to support the safety or effectiveness of 714-X. A number of anecdotal reports (incomplete descriptions of the medical and treatment history of one or more patients) and testimonials (personal reports from people who claim to have been helped or cured by the product) have been published in newspapers and other nonmedical literature. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) reviewed the records of some cancer patients who used 714-X. This review was done to decide if NCI should begin a clinical trial of the product. Not enough information was available to support recommending a trial.\\n\\nHave any side effects or risks been reported from 714-X? The makers of 714-X claim that it is not harmful to humans. The reported side effects of treatment with 714-X are redness, tenderness, and swelling at the injection site.\\n\\nIs 714-X approved by the FDA as a cancer treatment in the United States? The FDA has not approved 714-X for use in the United States.', 'Cancer Pain (PDQ®): Supportive care - Health Professional Information [NCI] This information is produced and provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

The goal of the following summary is to provide evidence-based, up-to-date, and practical information on the management of cancer pain.\\n\\nEffective pain management can generally be accomplished by paying attention to the following steps:[1]\\n\\nRegular screening to ensure that the patient\\'s pain is recognized early. (Refer to the Pain Assessment section of this summary for more information.) Proper characterization of the pain to identify underlying pathophysiology, which could significantly influence treatment options. (Refer to the Pain Classification section of this summary for more information). Is the pain acute or chronic? Is it secondary to cancer, cancer treatment, other causes, or a combination? Is it somatic, visceral, neuropathic, or mixed? Is there an incidental component? Is there breakthrough pain? Determining whether the pain requires pharmacologic and/or other modalities of treatment. Pain is often multifactorial in nature, so factors that may modulate pain expression, such as psychological distress and substance use, should be assessed. (Refer to the Background and Definitions section of this summary for more information.) What is the impact of pain on the patient? Is the benefit of treatment likely going to outweigh the risks? Identifying the optimal pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options (refer to the Pharmacologic Therapies for Pain Control section of this summary for more information), including referrals to specialists, if needed. (Refer to the Modalities for Pain Control: Other Approaches section of this summary for more information.) Complex pain often requires multidimensional interdisciplinary evaluation and intervention.\\n\\nThere are many issues to consider when determining the most appropriate treatment, such as the following: Previous pain treatments. Patient prognosis. Predictive factors for pain control (e.g., psychological distress). Impact on function. Comorbidities (e.g., renal or hepatic failure). Risk of misuse of or addiction to pain medications. Patient preference. Providing proper education about treatment, including medication administration, expected side effects and associated treatments, and when patients can expect improvement. If opioids are considered, fear of opioids and the risks of opioid use and misuse should be addressed. Patients and family caregivers should be educated about the safe storage, use, and disposal of opioids. One study demonstrated that improper use, storage, and disposal are common among cancer outpatients. [2] Monitoring the patient longitudinally with return visits to titrate/adjust treatments. Patients with cancer or noncancer pain requiring chronic therapy are monitored closely to optimize treatment and to minimize the likelihood of complications of opioid use, including misuse or abuse. The risks and benefits of opioid use are evaluated regularly, and physician impressions are discussed openly with the patient. Background and Definitions\\n\\nThe International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. \"[3] Pain is commonly experienced by cancer patients. Its proper assessment requires the following:', \"Measuring pain intensity. Clarifying the impact of pain on patients' psychological, social, spiritual, and existential domains. Establishing treatment adherence and responsiveness. A commonly used approach to pain management employs the three-step World Health Organization (WHO) pain relief ladder, which categorizes pain intensity according to severity and recommends analgesic agents based on their strength. [4] Pain intensity is often assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10. On this scale, 0 indicates no pain, 1 to 3 indicates mild pain, 4 to 6 indicates moderate pain, and 7 to 10 indicates severe pain. [5]\\n\\nFollowing is a summary of the three steps in the WHO cancer pain ladder for adults:\\n\\nStep 1 treats mild pain. Patients in this category receive nonopioid analgesics such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or an adjuvant analgesic, if necessary. Step 2 treats patients experiencing mild to moderate pain who are already taking a nonopioid analgesic, with or without an adjuvant analgesic, but who are still experiencing poor analgesia. Step 2 agents include tramadol and acetaminophen products containing hydrocodone, oxycodone, and codeine. Step 3 treats moderate to severe pain with strong analgesics. Step 3 opioids include morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, levorphanol, methadone, oxymorphone, and oxycodone. The results of an open-label randomized trial of low-dose morphine versus weak opioids to treat moderate cancer pain suggested that it is acceptable to bypass weak opioids and go directly to strong opioids (step 3 agents) for patients with moderate cancer pain, as patients randomly assigned to the low-dose morphine group had more frequent and greater reduction in pain intensity with similarly good tolerability and earlier effect. [6]\\n\\nFamiliarity with opioid pharmacokinetics, equianalgesic dosing, and adverse effects is necessary for their safe and effective use. The appropriate use of adjuvant pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions is needed to optimize pain management.\\n\\nPrevalence\\n\\nPain occurs in 20% to 50% of patients with cancer. [7] Roughly 80% of patients with advanced-stage cancer have moderate to severe pain. [8] One meta-analysis looking at pooled data from 52 studies found that more than half of patients had pain. [9] Younger patients are more likely to experience cancer pain and pain flares than are older patients. [10]\\n\\nCauses of Cancer Pain: Cancer, Cancer Treatments, and Comorbidities\\n\\nA study evaluating the characteristics of patients (N = 100) with advanced cancer presenting to a palliative care service found the primary tumor as the chief cause of pain in 68% of patients. [11] Most pain was somatic, and pain was as likely to be continuous as intermittent.\\n\\nPain can be caused by the following:\\n\\nSurgery. Radiation therapy. Chemotherapy. Targeted therapy. Supportive care therapies. Diagnostic procedures. A systematic review of the literature identified reports of pain occurring in 59% of patients receiving anticancer treatment and in 33% of patients after curative treatments. [9] The prevalence of chronic nonmalignant pain—such as chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis pain, fibromyalgia, and chronic daily headaches—has not been well characterized in cancer patients. It has been reported to range from 2% to 76%, depending on the patient population and how pain was assessed. [12,13,14,15]\\n\\nPostoperative pain\", 'Postoperative pain\\n\\nPain is an expected consequence of surgery. Concerns about the prevalence of opioid misuse have drawn increasing attention to how opioids are prescribed in common settings, including postoperatively. Studies suggest widespread variation in the prescribing patterns of opioids in the postoperative setting. [16] One study of opioid use after orthopedic and general surgery procedures found that, on average, only between 19% and 34% of the opioids prescribed were used and that the quantity of opioids prescribed after a given procedure varied widely by provider. [16] This finding led to the evaluation of utilization data and recommendations for standardizing the quantity of opioids prescribed for five common general surgery procedures. [17] An educational intervention based on those recommendations was associated with a 53% decrease in prescribed opioids after those five general surgery procedures, with only 1 patient in a cohort of 246 patients requiring an opioid refill. [18]\\n\\nThe opioid epidemic has also raised questions about whether postoperative use of opioids can lead to misuse. New persistent opioid use develops in 6% to 8% of opioid-naïve patients after noncancer surgery. [19,20,21] In a large retrospective analysis of patients undergoing curative-intent cancer surgery, 10.4% of opioid-naïve patients developed new persistent opioid use, defined as filling opioid prescriptions 90 to 180 days after surgery. At 1 year postsurgery, these patients were using an average of six 5-mg hydrocodone (or equivalent) tablets per day. Among the risk factors evaluated, only the use of adjuvant chemotherapy increased the risk of new persistent opioid use (15%–21% risk with adjuvant chemotherapy vs. 7%–11% risk with no chemotherapy). [22] In summary, one in ten patients undergoing curative-intent cancer surgery may be at risk of postoperative persistent opioid use.\\n\\nInfusion\\n\\nrelated pain syndromes\\n\\nThe infusion of intravenous chemotherapy causes four pain syndromes:[23,24,25]\\n\\nVenous spasm, which is treated by the application of a warm compress or a decrease in the infusion rate. Chemical phlebitis, which may result from chemotherapy or nonchemotherapy infusions such as potassium chloride and hyperosmolar solutions. [24] Vesicant extravasation, which may cause intense pain followed by desquamation and ulceration. [23] Anthracycline-associated flare, a venous flare reaction that may be caused by doxorubicin and includes local urticaria, pain, or stinging. [25] Some chemotherapy agents such as vinorelbine may cause pain at the tumor site. [26]\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nrelated mucositis\\n\\nSevere mucositis often occurs as a consequence of myeloablative chemotherapy and standard-intensity therapy. [27] Cytotoxic agents commonly associated with mucositis are cytarabine, doxorubicin, etoposide, fluorouracil (5-FU), and methotrexate. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors also cause mucositis. [28,29] Risk factors for mucositis include preexisting oral pathology, poor dental hygiene, and younger age. [27]\\n\\nWhite blood cell growth factor–related bone pain\\n\\nFilgrastim and pegfilgrastim are recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) that increase proliferation and differentiation of neutrophil precursors. Ostealgia is a significant adverse effect caused by G-CSFs that can occur in 20% to 71% of patients. [30] This bone pain starts within 2 days of a pegfilgrastim dose and lasts for 2 to 4 days. Although the mechanism by which G-CSFs cause bone pain is largely unknown, it is hypothesized that histamine release, creating local inflammation and edema, may play a role. A phase II trial randomly assigned patients who had experienced bone pain with pegfilgrastim to receive either daily loratadine 10 mg for 7 days or matching placebo after subsequent doses of pegfilgrastim. [31] There was no statistically significant difference between the two arms.', 'A second phase II trial randomly assigned patients receiving pegfilgrastim to receive naproxen, loratadine, or no preventative medications. [32] The percentage of patients experiencing any grade bone pain was 40.3% in the naproxen group, 42.5% in the loratadine group, and 46.6% in the no-prophylaxis group. Although there was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups, the authors concluded that loratadine administration has a favorable risk-to-benefit profile and should be considered.\\n\\nConventional pain medications have also been studied in this area. A phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of naproxen for the prevention of pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain randomly assigned patients to receive either naproxen 500 mg twice daily for 5 to 8 days after pegfilgrastim administration or placebo. [33] Naproxen reduced overall pain intensity and duration of pain, compared with placebo.\\n\\nChemotherapy\\n\\nrelated musculoskeletal pain\\n\\nPaclitaxel generates a syndrome of diffuse arthralgias and myalgias in 10% to 20% of patients. [34] Diffuse pain in joints and muscles appears 1 to 2 days after the infusion and lasts a median of 4 to 5 days. Pain originates in the back, hips, shoulders, thighs, legs, and feet. Weight bearing, walking, or tactile contact exacerbates the pain. Steroids may reduce the tendency to develop myalgia and arthralgias. Among hormonal therapies, aromatase inhibitors cause musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporotic fractures, arthralgias, and myalgias. [35]\\n\\nDermatologic complications and chemotherapy\\n\\nEGFR inhibitors cause dermatitis with ensuing pain. [36] Acute herpetic neuralgia occurs with a significantly increased incidence among cancer patients, especially those with hematologic malignancies and those receiving immunosuppressive therapies. [37] The pain usually resolves within 2 months but can persist and become postherpetic neuralgia. The palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome is observed in association with continuously infused 5-FU, capecitabine,[38] liposomal doxorubicin,[39] and paclitaxel. [40] Targeted agents such as sorafenib and sunitinib are also associated with hand-foot–like syndrome. [41] Patients develop tingling or burning in their palms and soles, followed by an erythematous rash. Management often requires discontinuing therapy or reducing the treatment dose.\\n\\nSupportive care therapies and pain\\n\\nSupportive care therapies can cause pain, as typified by bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw. [42] Corticosteroid use has also been associated with the development of avascular necrosis. [43]\\n\\nRadiation\\n\\ninduced pain\\n\\nRadiation is associated with several distinct pain syndromes. First, patients may experience pain from brachytherapy and from positioning during treatment (i.e., placement on a radiation treatment table). Second, delayed tissue damage such as mucositis, mucosal inflammation in areas receiving radiation, and dermatitis may be painful. Third, a temporary worsening of pain in the treated area (a pain flare) is a potential side effect of radiation treatment for bone metastases. [44] A randomized trial demonstrated that dexamethasone (8 mg on day of radiation therapy and daily for the following 4 days) reduces the incidence of pain flares, compared with placebo. [45] (Refer to the External-Beam Radiation Therapy section of this summary for more information.)\\n\\nImpact on Function and QOL\\n\\nCancer pain is associated with increased emotional distress. Both pain duration and pain severity correlate with risk of developing depression. Cancer patients are disabled an average of 12 to 20 days per month, with 28% to 55% unable to work because of their cancer. [46] Cancer survivors may experience distress when their pain unexpectedly persists after completion of cancer treatments. [47] Survivors also experience loss of support from their previous health care team as oncologists transition their care back to primary care providers.', 'In one study, between 20% and 50% of cancer patients continued to experience pain and functional limitations years posttreatment. [48] Untreated pain leads to requests for physician-assisted suicide. [49] Untreated pain also leads to unnecessary hospital admissions and visits to emergency departments. [50]', 'Cancer: Controlling Cancer Pain Introduction Having cancer does not mean that you have to live with pain. Cancer and some of the treatments for it can cause pain. But most people who have cancer are able to manage their pain well.footnote1\\n\\nCancer pain can almost always be controlled. Only you know how you feel and how much pain you have. Tell your health care team what your pain feels like and what works and does not work. Don\\'t wait for pain to get bad. Your pain medicine will work best if you use it when you first notice pain, before it becomes bad. If you are taking pain medicine regularly for cancer pain, have a plan (and medicines on hand) for breakthrough pain. This is sudden and intense pain that can happen while you are already taking pain medicine. Many people worry that taking opioid pain medicines will lead to opioid use disorder. Moderate to severe opioid use disorder is sometimes called addiction. Do not let this fear stop you from getting the pain relief you need. Your doctor will monitor you closely for signs of this disorder. Managing your pain can mean treating other problems, too. Uncontrolled cancer pain can lead to anxiety, sleep problems, or depression.\\n\\nHow can I control the pain caused by cancer? Keep track of your pain and your treatments Your doctor needs all the information you can give about what your pain feels like. Your doctor needs to know how your treatment is working or not working. It may be easier to give your doctor information if you write it down. Use a daily diary to rate your pain. Write down what drugs you are taking and how well they are working. Write down any other methods you are using to control your pain.\\n\\nPay attention to the details of your pain so you can tell your doctor. Is it burning? Throbbing? Steady? How long does it last? Take your written information and your questions with you when you see your doctor.\\n\\nUse a calendar or a pain control diary [PDF] to keep track of your treatment. Write down how strong your pain is and when it comes and goes. Most doctors use a \"0 to 10\" scale to measure pain. On this scale, \"0\" means no pain and \"10\" means the worst possible pain.\\n\\nIt is easy to get confused about medicines when you are in pain and are looking for something to help you feel better. You may have prescriptions from more than one doctor. Keeping a written medicine record [PDF] can help you and your doctors work together.\\n\\nStay on top of your pain Your pain will be harder to control if you let it get worse before you take your medicine. Make the most of your pain medicines by following these rules:\\n\\nTake them on time (by the clock). Do not skip a dose or wait until you think you need it. Be prepared for breakthrough pain. You may find that taking your medicine works most of the time, but your pain flares up during extra activity or even for no clear reason. This is called breakthrough pain. Your doctor can give you a prescription for fast-acting medicines that you can take for breakthrough pain. Ask one of your doctors to be your team leader. It is best to have one doctor in charge of all your medicines. If more than one doctor prescribes pain medicine, make sure they talk to each other about it. Manage the side effects Pain medicines may cause side effects. For example, opioid pain relievers may cause drowsiness, constipation, nausea, and vomiting. Some anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, may cause stomach upset or bleeding. Before you start taking a drug, ask your doctor about the possible side effects.\\n\\nThere are things you can do to manage some side effects.', \"There are things you can do to manage some side effects.\\n\\nHome treatment for nausea or vomitingincludes eating clear soups, mild foods, and liquids if you feel nauseated. Watch for and treat early signs of dehydration. Older adults can quickly become dehydrated from vomiting. Home treatment for constipation includes making sure that you drink enough fluids and include fruits, vegetables, and fiber in your diet each day. Do not use a laxative without first talking to your doctor. Complementary medicine Complementary medicine is the term for a wide variety of health care practices that may be used along with standard medical treatment. These therapies are helpful in managing pain for some people.\\n\\nMost of these therapies have not been subjected to the same degree of rigorous scientific testing for safety and effectiveness that standard medical treatments must go through before they are approved in the United States. Be sure to talk with your doctor about which therapies might be best for you.\\n\\nBehavioral therapies\\n\\nBiofeedback is a method of consciously controlling a body function that is normally controlled unconsciously, such as skin temperature, muscle tension, heart rate, or blood pressure. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a type of counseling that can help you cope with pain by modifying certain thought and behavior patterns. Relaxation exercises can help reduce tension and stress. Physical therapies\\n\\nTai chi, yoga, and other forms of movement can help you keep your strength, flexibility, and mobility. Heat and cold treatments relieve sore muscles and decrease pain. Massage helps reduce tension and pain, improves circulation, and encourages relaxation. Other therapies\\n\\nAcupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine. It is done by inserting very thin needles into the skin at certain points on the body. Acupuncture may help relieve pain.footnote2 Aromatherapy is the therapeutic use of aroma-producing oils (essential oils) extracted from a plant's flowers, leaves, stalks, bark, rind, or roots. These oils are mixed with another substance, such as oil, alcohol, or lotion, and then applied to the skin, sprayed in the air, or inhaled. Healing touch is the conscious influence of one person on another, without physical means of intervention, to benefit the recipient's physical or emotional well-being. Meditation is the practice of focusing your attention to alter your state of consciousness, usually directed toward feeling calm and having a clear awareness about your life.\", 'Cancer Prevention Overview (PDQ®): Prevention - Health Professional Information [NCI] This information is produced and provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The information in this topic may have changed since it was written. For the most current information, contact the National Cancer Institute via the Internet web site at http://cancer.gov or call 1-800-4-CANCER.\\n\\nThe Burden of Cancer\\n\\nDescription of the Evidence Prevention is defined as the reduction of cancer mortality via reduction in the incidence of cancer. This can be accomplished by avoiding a carcinogen or altering its metabolism; pursuing lifestyle or dietary practices that modify cancer-causing factors or genetic predispositions; medical interventions (e.g., chemoprevention) or risk-reducing surgical procedures; or early detection strategies that can result in removal of precancerous lesions, such as colonoscopy for colorectal polyps.\\n\\nAbout the PDQ Cancer Prevention Summaries\\n\\nThe PDQ cancer prevention summaries are primarily organized by specific anatomic cancer site to facilitate consideration of the unique characteristics of specific malignancies. In this section, an overview of cancer prevention strategies is provided, including a summary of evidence for selected preventive strategies used in the prevention of a broad spectrum of malignancies. The strength of evidence and magnitude of effects of these strategies, however, may vary by cancer site. Other PDQ cancer prevention summaries address the prevention of specific types of cancer and provide more detailed descriptions of the evidence.\\n\\nThere are many common beliefs or speculations about causes of cancer. However, putative causes of cancer for which there exist very little scientific evidence, positive or negative, are not considered in these summaries. Therefore, absence of an environmental, dietary, or lifestyle factor from these summaries implies insufficient evidence for detailed consideration and not necessarily absence of effect. Many such factors are deserving of research regarding their potential roles in cancer, but if that research does not exist, has not been published, or the Editorial Board judges the research to be of insufficient quantity or of poor quality, they are not addressed in these summaries.\\n\\nCarcinogenesis\\n\\nCarcinogenesis refers to an underlying etiologic pathway that leads to cancer. Several models of carcinogenesis have been proposed. Knudson proposed a \"two-hit\" model requiring a mutation in both copies of a gene resulting in cancer. Expansion of this concept has resulted in other widely cited models of carcinogenesis including those of Vogelstein and Kinzler [1] and Hanahan and Weinberg. [2] The model of Vogelstein and Kinzler emphasizes that cancer is ultimately a disease of damaged DNA, comprised of a series of genetic mutations that can transform normal cells to cancerous cells. The genetic mutations include inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes. Compared with cancers arising in the general population, individuals with a major inherited predisposition to cancer are born with inherited (i.e., germline) mutations in genes involved in cancer causation, giving them a head start on the pathway to cancer. Similar mutations would be expected to result in cancer progression among all individuals; however, in those without a major inherited cancer predisposition, the mutation would occur as a somatic mutation later during their lifetime.', \"The model of Hanahan and Weinberg focuses on the hallmark events at the cellular level that lead to a malignant tumor. In this model, the hallmarks of cancer include sustained angiogenesis, limitless replicative potential, evading apoptosis, self-sufficiency in growth signals, and insensitivity to antigrowth signals, leading to the defining characteristics of malignant tumors, which give them the ability to invade and metastasize. This model highlights the fact that malignant tumors arise and flourish within the environment of a whole organism. The tissue organizational field theory [3] posits that carcinogenesis is better conceptualized at the level of tissues rather than cells. This theory is based on the dual premise that carcinogenesis is driven by defects in tissue organization and that all cells are inherently in a proliferative state.\\n\\nModels of carcinogenesis such as these are purposefully simplistic but, nevertheless, illustrate that carcinogenesis requires a constellation of steps that often take place for decades.\\n\\nThe complexity of carcinogenesis is magnified when one considers that the specific details of the carcinogenic pathway described by these models would be expected to have unique characteristics for each anatomic site. Under these circumstances, the risk factors and clinical characteristics of malignancies exhibit considerable variation by anatomic site and by different tumor types within the same anatomic site. For these reasons, human cancer is really not a single disease but is a family of different diseases.\\n\\nRisk Factors\\n\\nThe promise for cancer prevention is derived from observational epidemiologic studies that show associations between modifiable lifestyle factors or environmental exposures and specific cancers. The expectation is that, if a risk factor truly causes cancer, it would also be the case that a lifestyle modification (i.e., changing one's risk profile from bad to good) would actually reduce cancer risk, at least partially. This expectation can be fulfilled only if the association is due to a causal (and ideally, reversible) relationship. Because observational studies rarely provide conclusive evidence of such relationships, additional evidence is required. [4] For a few exposures, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have tested whether interventions suggested by epidemiologic studies and leads based on laboratory research result in reduced cancer incidence and mortality.\\n\\nRisk factors causally associated with cancer\\n\\nCigarette smoking/tobacco use\\n\\nDecades of research have consistently established the strong association between tobacco use and cancers of many sites. Specifically, cigarette smoking has been established as a cause of a range of cancers; including lung, oral cavity, esophageal, bladder, kidney, pancreatic, stomach, and cervical cancers, and acute myelogenous leukemia. The body of epidemiologic evidence confirming these associations is substantial. Further support is demonstrated by the lung cancer death rates in the United States, which have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men. As a single exposure that is relatively easy to measure accurately, this extensive body of evidence has led to the estimation that cigarette smoking causes 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States. Smoking avoidance and smoking cessation result in decreased incidence and mortality from cancer. [5] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Lung Cancer Prevention; Lung Cancer Screening; and Cigarette Smoking: Health Risks and How to Quit for more information.)\\n\\nInfections\", \"Infections\\n\\nGlobally, infectious agents have been estimated to cause about 15% of all cancer cases. [6,7] The burden of cancers caused by infections is much greater in developing nations (26%) than in developed nations (8%). Infection with an oncogenic strain of human papillomavirus (HPV) is considered a necessary event for subsequent cervical cancer, and vaccine-conferred immunity results in a marked decrease in precancerous lesions. Oncogenic strains of HPV are also linked with cancers of the penis, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Other examples of infectious agents that cause cancer are hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (liver cancer), Epstein-Barr virus (Burkitt lymphoma), and Helicobacter pylori (gastric cancer). [7] If an infectious agent is truly a cause of cancer, then efficacious, anti-infective interventions would be expected in most instances to be effective cancer-prevention interventions. This is the expectation with vaccines that protect against infection with oncogenic strains of HPV. (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Cervical Cancer Prevention; Cervical Cancer Screening; Liver (Hepatocellular) Cancer Prevention; and Liver (Hepatocellular) Cancer Screening for more information.)\\n\\nRadiation\\n\\nRadiation is energy in the form of high-speed particles or electromagnetic waves. Exposure to radiation, primarily ultraviolet (UV) radiation and ionizing radiation, is a clearly established cause of cancer. Exposure to solar UV radiation is the major cause of nonmelanoma skin cancers, which are by far the most common malignancies in human populations. [8]\\n\\nIonizing radiation is radiation with enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from their orbits, causing atoms to become charged or ionized. Ions formed in the molecules of living cells can go on to react with and potentially damage other molecules in the cell. At low doses (e.g., those associated with background radiation), the cells repair the damage rapidly. At moderate doses, the cells may be changed permanently or die from their inability to repair the damage. Cells changed permanently may go on to produce abnormal cells when they divide, and in some circumstances, these altered cells may become cancerous or lead to other abnormalities (e.g., birth defects). Defects in ability to repair damage caused by ionizing radiation may influence the impact of radiation exposure on cancer risk.\\n\\nThere is extensive epidemiologic and biologic evidence that links exposure to ionizing radiation with the development of cancer, and in particular, cancer that involves the hematological system, breast, lungs, and thyroid. The National Research Council of the National Academies' Committee to Assess the Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation report, the Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII,[9] the most widely cited source on the topic, concluded after a comprehensive review of the medical literature that no dose of radiation should be considered completely safe, and attempts should be made to keep radiation doses as low as possible. In this report, several lines of evidence were cited documenting the association between ionizing radiation exposure and cancer. The first line of evidence comes from studies of the development of cancer among Japanese atomic-bomb survivors. Even at low doses of radiation, atomic-bomb survivors were at increased risk of developing cancer. [9] The second line of evidence comes from epidemiological studies of medically irradiated populations who were therapeutically irradiated for both malignant and benign diseases. Following high-dose radiation therapy for malignant disease, the risk of secondary malignancy is high. The relatively common use of radiation for benign disease between 1940 and 1960 resulted in a substantially increased relative risk (RR) of developing cancer.\\n\\nAn additional line of evidence comes from an increased risk of cancer-specific mortality associated with exposure to medical ionizing radiation, for both the recipients of diagnostic x-rays and x-ray personnel.\", \"The major sources of population exposure to ionizing radiation are medical radiation (including x-rays, computed tomography [CT], fluoroscopy, and nuclear medicine) and naturally occurring radon gas in the basements of homes. Limiting unnecessary CT scans and other diagnostic studies, as well as reducing radiation exposure doses, are important prevention strategies. [10,11] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Breast Cancer Prevention; Breast Cancer Screening; Skin Cancer Prevention; and Lung Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nExposure to ionizing radiation has increased during the last two decades as a result of the dramatic increase in the use of CT. Exposure to ionizing radiation associated with CT is in the range where carcinogenesis has been demonstrated. [12,13] Repeat exposure to radiation from medical imaging will further increase cancer risk, because risk is proportional to exposure. One study found that half the subjects who were exposed to radiation from medical imaging underwent repeat imaging within 3 years. Overall, 0.2% of the nearly 1 million participants followed for 3 years received doses above 50 mSv. [14]\\n\\nOne approach to estimate the potential contribution of exposure to ionizing radiation from medical imaging is to develop statistical models based on the estimated cancer risks associated with a range of dose levels. For example, one estimate of the CT scans performed in the United States in 2007 predicted that 29,000 (95% uncertainty limits of 15,000–45,000) cancers might result in the future. One-third of the projected cancers were caused by CT scans done on individuals aged 35 to 54 years. This estimate was derived from risk models based on organ-specific radiation doses from national surveys, frequency of CT scans in 2007 by age and sex from survey and insurance claim data, and the National Research Council of the National Academies' report, Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation. [12]\\n\\nData are now emerging from studies large enough to directly estimate the cancer risk associated with diagnostic imaging using ionizing radiation. For example, in a cohort of 10.9 million Australians, electronic medical records were used to document the diagnostic CT scans of youths who received CT scans when they were aged 0 to 19 years. This cohort was then linked to the National Death Index and Australian Cancer Database. [15] Compared with those who did not have a CT scan, those who had at least one CT scan were statistically significantly more likely to be diagnosed with cancer as they were followed into young adulthood (RR, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20–1.29; average follow-up in those who had a CT was 9.5 years). A statistically significant dose-response relationship was observed, with cancer risk increasing with each additional CT scan. Thus, the findings of cohort studies with directly measured CT scans now substantiate the statistical models and document the real-world cancer risks associated with exposure to ionizing radiation via medical imaging.\\n\\nDiagnostic imaging in childhood and adolescence is even associated with an elevated risk of a broad range of solid and hematologic malignancies at a young age. In a population-based South Korean cohort of more than 12 million children aged 0 to 19 years, the incidence rate ratio of cancers in the 10.6% of those exposed to diagnostic radiation was 1.64 after a lag period of 2 years since exposure (95% CI, 1.56–1.73; P < .001), compared with those who had no exposure. [16]\\n\\nImmunosuppression after organ transplantation\", 'Immunosuppression after organ transplantation\\n\\nMedications that suppress the immune system in patients undergoing organ transplantation are associated with an increased cancer risk. [17] A retrospective population-based cohort study of solid-organ transplant recipients in Ontario, Canada, during a 20-year period demonstrated that solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of cancer-specific death, regardless of age, sex, and organ transplanted. The risk is higher during the first 6 months posttransplant but persists for many years. It is especially high for cancers linked to viral infections. As outcomes of transplantation have improved, cancer mortality from secondary cancers has increased and is now the second most common cause of death after transplantation. [18]\\n\\nRisk/protective factors with uncertain associations with cancer\\n\\nDiet\\n\\nEstimates concerning the potential contribution of diet to the population burden of cancer have varied widely. [19] In contrast to the epidemiologic evidence on cigarette smoking and cancer, evidence for the influence of dietary factors and cancer is uncertain. An assessment of the potential role of diet entails measuring the net contribution of diets, comprising factors that may protect against cancer and other factors that may increase cancer risk. Measuring an individual\\'s usual diet and its direct relevance to cancer risk also poses challenges. [20]\\n\\nExamples in which the type of study design led to substantively different results further illustrate the complexities of the relationship between food and nutrient intake and human cancer risk. Observational epidemiologic studies (case-control and cohort studies), which used self-reported dietary assessments that are prone to substantial measurement error, have suggested associations between diet and cancer development, but randomized trials of interventions provided little or no support. For example, on the basis of population-based epidemiologic data, high-fiber diets were recommended to prevent colon neoplasms. However, a 2017 Cochrane database systematic review of RCTs of supplemental fiber found a lack of evidence to suggest that increased dietary fiber intake will reduce the recurrence of adenomatous polyps in those with a history of adenomatous polyps within a 2- to 8-year period. [21] Likewise, systematic evidence reviews of cohort studies,[22,23] and randomized trials [24], found small or uncertain effects of red meat intake or reduction in intake on overall cancer incidence and mortality. The overall quality of evidence was graded as low to very low.\\n\\nAssociations reported from observational epidemiologic analysis based on self-reported assessments should be viewed in the context of the limitations as described in the above text. On the other hand, stronger evidence of causal relationships is unlikely to be provided by relatively short-term RCTs, especially if life-long dietary patterns or dietary intake during specific life stages are most important in inducing or preventing cancer.\\n\\nAlcohol\\n\\nWith respect to dietary factors that may increase cancer risk, the strongest evidence in the World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) report was for drinking alcohol. The evidence was judged to be \"convincing\" that drinking alcohol increased the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, breast, and colorectum (the latter in men). Further, the evidence was judged to be \"probable\" that drinking alcohol increased the risk of liver cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC) (the latter in women).\\n\\nIn relation to human cancer, diets reflect the sum total of a complex mixture of exposures, as demonstrated by the examples of fruit/vegetable intake and alcohol consumption. No dietary factors appear to be uniformly relevant to all forms of cancer. (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Breast Cancer Prevention; Colorectal Cancer Prevention; and Lung Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nPhysical activity', 'Physical activity\\n\\nA growing body of epidemiologic evidence suggests that people who are more physically active have a lower risk of certain malignancies than those who are more sedentary. In the WCRF/AICR report, the evidence was judged to be \"convincing\" that increased physical activity protects against CRC. The evidence was also judged to be \"probable\" that physical activity was associated with lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer and endometrial cancer. As with the dietary factors described above, physical activity seems to play a more prominent role in selected malignancies. The inverse associations observed for selected malignancies make this a promising area for cancer prevention research, particularly because causal associations have not been established. The excess risk of many cancers seen with obesity, in combination with evidence to suggest that physical activity is inversely associated with at least a few cancers, raises the hypothesis that energy balance may influence cancer risk. (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Breast Cancer Prevention; Colorectal Cancer Prevention; and Endometrial Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nObesity\\n\\nObesity is being increasingly recognized as an important cancer risk factor. The WCRF/AICR report concluded that obesity is convincingly linked to postmenopausal breast cancer and cancers of the esophagus, pancreas, colorectum, endometrium, and kidney. Furthermore, the WCRF/AICR report judged body fatness to be a probable risk factor for cancer of the gallbladder and the evidence to be \"limited suggestive\" for liver cancer. These conclusions from the WCRF/AICR evidence review were corroborated in a cohort study based on medical records data from 5.24 million adults in the United Kingdom. [25] The results of this U.K. cohort study also bolstered the evidence for an association between body mass index (BMI) and cancer of the gall bladder (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1–1.5 per 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI) and for liver cancer (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.12–1.27 per 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI). [25] A prospective study of nationally representative cohorts that examined obesity in relation to cancer mortality emphasized that factors associated with cancer do not uniformly apply to all human malignancies. The study results revealed that obesity was associated with an increased risk of dying from obesity-associated malignancies, but obesity was not associated with overall cancer mortality.\\n\\n[26] If the associations between obesity and the cancers mentioned above are causal, which has yet to be established, the current increase in the prevalence of obesity in the United States and elsewhere poses a severe challenge to cancer prevention efforts. The magnitude of the impact of obesity on public health and the population burden of cancer is likely to be substantial, but is expected to be less than that of cigarette smoking. Smoking has a high prevalence and is causally associated with 13 types of cancer, and the magnitude of the associations are often much stronger than those observed for obesity. Furthermore, weight loss has yet to be shown to reduce the risk of obesity-associated malignancies. [27] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Breast Cancer Prevention; Colorectal Cancer Prevention; Endometrial Cancer Prevention; and Lung Cancer Prevention for more information.)', 'A recent analysis [4] of the long-running Nurses\\' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study estimated the proportions of cancer cases and deaths in the U.S. population on the basis of adoption of a low-risk lifestyle (characterized by being a never-smoker or former smoker, drinking alcohol moderately or not at all, having a BMI between 18.5 and 27.5, and meeting the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans). One major weakness of the study was that its premise assumed the causality of the nonsmoking risk factors. The analysis was further weakened by using self-reported measures of diet and alcohol use, and by measuring only leisure-time (rather than all) physical activity. Also, the authors did not present the effects of the nonsmoking risk factors after accounting for smoking. This analysis and others with similar weaknesses should therefore be interpreted cautiously.\\n\\nDiabetes\\n\\nObservational studies suggest that all-cancer incidence and mortality are slightly increased (10%–15%) in individuals with diabetes, although the increase is greater for certain organ sites and null for others. [28,29,30] Given that there is biologic heterogeneity in diabetes and cancer, that diabetes and cancer share a number of risk factors, and that diabetes almost always requires long-term medication use, it is not possible to say what the observed associations (especially those that are small) actually represent. Furthermore, most observational studies rely on self-reports of diabetes (as \"has diabetes\" or \"does not have diabetes\"), making it impossible to explore whether associations differ by diabetic type or severity, degree of diabetic control, and other factors that can be determined only through the use of biospecimens and repeated measures. These limitations must be kept in mind when findings are interpreted.\\n\\nAt least four of the following characteristics of diabetes have been hypothesized to increase cancer risk:\\n\\nHyperinsulinemia (including insulin resistance). Hyperglycemia. Downregulation of sex hormone–binding globulin. Chronic inflammation. Diabetes and cancer share a number of risk factors, including aging, obesity, smoking, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity. [5] Diabetes treatments include exogenous insulin injections, as well as oral medications that modify insulin secretion and sensitivity, reduce blood glucose levels, or prevent the kidneys from reabsorbing blood glucose. [31]\\n\\nIn prospective observational studies, risk of, and death due to, liver, pancreas, colon/colorectum, and female breast cancer are consistently higher in persons with diabetes. Increases in risk or death also have been observed for cancer of the endometrium, ovary, bladder, and oral cavity/pharynx. In a prospective cohort with long-term follow-up of more than a million U.S. adults [29]—with analyses that controlled for age, education, BMI, smoking, alcohol intake, vegetable intake, red meat intake, physical activity, and aspirin use—the greatest increase in mortality for the aforementioned cancer sites was for liver cancer in males (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.89–2.70); the lowest was for breast cancer in females (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03–1.29). With the exception of death due to male breast cancer (analysis included 12 patients with diabetes who were dying of the cancer), the remainder of positive statistically significant RRs were no greater than 1.5. A pooled data analysis of 97 prospective studies (almost 821,000 individuals) that controlled for age, smoking status, and BMI, and presented non–sex-stratified hazard ratios (HRs),[28] reported findings similar to those in the aforementioned study; however, contrary to that study, increases in risk of death caused by lung (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.13–1.43) and ovarian cancer (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.03–2.02) were found.', \"An umbrella review of meta-analyses [30] of type 2 diabetes and cancer reported a statistically significant 10% increase in risk of all-cancer incidence, a statistically significant 16% increase in all-cancer mortality, and statistically significant increases in the incidence of 12 cancers. Relative increases in the incidence of pancreas, endometrium, and liver cancer were roughly twofold and statistically significant.\\n\\nMetformin has been associated with a decrease in breast cancer incidence and mortality in observational studies and is currently under study in clinical trials. Metformin has been hypothesized to reduce risk by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation through adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–kinase activation. The use of medications that affect incretin receptor signaling has been postulated to increase pancreatic cancer incidence, but neither animal nor clinical data (which are limited) support this claim at this time. [32] Long-term use of exogenous, long-acting insulin has never consistently been shown to increase cancer risk.\\n\\nThe impact of screen detection on measures of risk\\n\\nMany of the groundbreaking observational studies in cancer etiology date back to a time when widespread cancer screening did not occur. Given the extensive uptake of screening for certain cancers over the past quarter-century, recently conducted observational etiologic studies included participants whose disease was detected through screening. When overdiagnosis exists with screening, and screening behavior or willingness to seek diagnostic evaluation is correlated with cancer risk factors, relative risk measures generated from today's etiology studies may not agree with those from studies conducted before the widespread use of screening. This is because overdiagnosed cases would never have been diagnosed in the absence of screening. For example, assume that blue eyes (relative to brown eyes) are associated with receiving prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening or preference for diagnostic biopsy, but not with prostate cancer. In the absence of screening, a null result would have been observed for the association of blue eyes and prostate cancer. In the presence of screening, blue eyes would be associated with prostate cancer, because blue eyes would lead to screening, and screening would detect overdiagnosed cases. [33]\\n\\nInterventions With Proven Benefits\\n\\nChemoprevention\\n\\nChemoprevention refers to the use of natural or synthetic compounds to interfere with early stages of carcinogenesis, before invasive cancer appears. [34] Several agents have proven benefit.\\n\\nSelective estrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen and raloxifene), taken daily for up to 5 years, reduce breast cancer incidence by 50% in high-risk women. [34] Widespread use of these medications for prevention is limited because of side effects (hot flashes, and in the case of tamoxifen, endometrial cancer). (Refer to the PDQ summary on Breast Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nFinasteride (an alpha-reductase inhibitor) lowers the incidence of prostate cancer. [35] Finasteride lowers PSA levels, resulting in fewer prostate biopsies, and shrinks normal prostate tissue, which allows easier detection of cancers. Both of these effects may account for the finding that finasteride recipients have an absolute higher incidence of high-grade prostate cancer, i.e., a lower incidence of low-risk cancer (lower overdiagnosis). Long-term follow-up (median, 18 years) after completion of the 7-year treatment intervention in the finasteride randomized trial demonstrated that there was a continued reduction in prostate cancer risk. Concerns regarding the increased number of high-grade tumors have been addressed with the long-term evidence of no increased risk of prostate cancer mortality in men who received finasteride (HR for risk of prostate cancer death, finasteride vs. placebo, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.50–1.12). [36] (Refer to the PDQ summary on Prostate Cancer Prevention for more information.)\", 'COX-2 inhibitors inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins. Evidence suggests that COX-2 inhibitors may prevent colon and breast cancer but concerns about cardiovascular risk preclude extensive study. An RCT of moderately high-dose celecoxib in patients with arthritis showed no difference in cardiovascular outcomes when compared with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). [37] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Breast Cancer Prevention and Colorectal Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nAspirin has been studied extensively as a chemopreventive agent. However, the evidence of benefit for the prevention of cancer or cancer deaths in the general population is mixed, but generally negative. A secondary analysis of pooled data from seven placebo-controlled RCTs with primary endpoints of vascular events showed that daily aspirin for at least 4 years reduced overall cancer deaths by 18% (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70–0.95). [38] The effect of aspirin on cancer incidence seems to be limited to CRC in this analysis. A more recent meta-analysis of 16 RCTs, with a mean follow-up of 5.48 years (range, 2–10.7 years) that compared aspirin (doses varying from 81–1,200 mg daily) with placebo controls did not reveal favorable effects of aspirin on cancer mortality (RR, 0.99; 95% CI 0.87–1.12), all-cause mortality (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.92–1.02), or cancer incidence (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.04). [39]\\n\\nA secondary analysis of cancer outcomes in a placebo-controlled RCT of aspirin/omega-3 fatty acid chemoprevention for cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus found no evidence of reduced gastrointestinal cancer risk caused by aspirin use, although the authors noted that the power to detect differences in cancer rates was low. [40] Only one randomized trial of aspirin for primary prevention focused on older individuals without a specific indication to take aspirin, and it suggests that aspirin use may have an adverse effect on cancer outcomes in the elderly. The Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial included study participants aged 70 years and older (≥65 years for African-Americans and Hispanics in the United States) who did not have cardiovascular disease, dementia, or disability. In contrast to other randomized trials of aspirin, an increase in all-cause mortality (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01–1.29) and risk of cancer death (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10–1.56) were observed in the aspirin group. An accompanying editorial highlighted that the follow-up time was slightly shorter than other similar trials and that results with continued follow-up will be informative. Additional characteristics of the trial included a study population that appeared to be healthier than the general population, and mortality rates that were lower in the study group compared with the general population of similar age, sex, and race/ethnicity distribution.\\n\\nAt year 5 of the trial, no evidence of a net benefit has been shown in this healthy population with no underlying reason or medical indications for aspirin use. [41,42] Of note, aspirin use was associated with a trend toward an increased risk of metastatic cancers (6.1 vs. 5.1 per 1,000 person-years; HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00–1.43), which tended to be metastatic at diagnosis. Post hoc analysis showed that aspirin use was also associated with a higher risk of death with cancers that presented at stages III (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.03–4.33) or IV (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.04–1.64), suggesting that aspirin use may accelerate cancer progression in the elderly. [43] A significant side effect of aspirin use is bleeding, which may preclude widespread use for cancer prevention. Evidence of harm from bleeding, including major bleeding, is more consistent than the evidence of benefit summarized above.', \"Because aspirin may help reduce death from cardiovascular disease (which is responsible for more deaths than cancer), use of aspirin should be considered in a larger context of prevention beyond cancer. Similarly, serious harms from bleeding (from the gastrointestinal tract or intracranially) should be considered in light of patients' individual risks of specific harms. (Refer to the PDQ summary on Colorectal Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nInterventions With No Proven Benefit\\n\\nVitamin and dietary supplement use\\n\\nSome have advocated vitamin and mineral supplements for cancer prevention. Many different mechanistic pathways for anticancer effects have been invoked. A commonly tested hypothesis is that antioxidant vitamins may protect against cancer, based on the premise that oxidative damage to DNA leads to cancer progression. Hence preventing oxidative DNA damage would prevent progression to cancer. However, the evidence is insufficient to support the use of multivitamin and mineral supplements or single vitamins or minerals to prevent cancer. [44] Beta carotene is an antioxidant that was thought to prevent or reverse smoking-related changes leading to lung cancer based on the results of several observational epidemiologic studies examining either dietary intake of beta carotene from food sources or blood levels as a marker of dietary intake. [45] However, two prospective, placebo-controlled trials found that smokers and former smokers who received beta carotene supplements had increased lung cancer incidence and mortality. [46]\\n\\nOther unanticipated adverse events have been documented for dietary supplement use. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of daily doses of calcium greater than or equal to 500 mg/day versus placebo documented that calcium supplements were associated with a significantly elevated risk of myocardial infarction (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01–1.59). [47] Dietary calcium intake has not been observed to be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. [48] The discrepancy in findings between calcium in the diet versus high-dose supplementation raises questions about the value of dietary supplements compared with dietary intake. The Iowa Women's Health Study, an observational study that enrolled over 40,000 women aged 55 to 69 years in 1986, examined the association between dietary supplement use and mortality. [49] Statistically significant excess mortality risk was observed with the use of multivitamins, vitamin B6, folic acid, iron, magnesium, zinc, and copper. Only calcium users were associated with a statistically significant reduction in mortality rates compared with nonusers.\\n\\nResearch into the potential anticancer properties of vitamin and mineral supplements is ongoing, and the results continue to reinforce the lack of efficacy of vitamin supplements in preventing cancer. The extended follow-up results of the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) found a statistically significant excess risk of prostate cancer associated with vitamin E supplementation (400 IU/day of all rac -α-tocopherol acetate) compared with placebo (HR, 1.17; 99% CI, 1.0004–1.36; P = .008). The absolute increase in risk of prostate cancer with vitamin E use was 1.6 per 1,000 person-years. Selenium did not reduce the risk of prostate cancer (HR, 1.09; 99% CI, 0.93–1.27). [50]\\n\\nThe results of the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) II demonstrated that supplementation with vitamin E and/or vitamin C had no benefit compared with placebo in preventing either prostate cancer incidence or total cancer incidence. [51]\", \"The results of the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study indicated that, compared with placebo, supplementation with vitamin C, vitamin E, or beta carotene was not efficacious in reducing total cancer incidence. [52] In this same study, daily supplements containing folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 were compared with placebo; this intervention was not efficacious in reducing the overall risk of developing cancer. [53] An exploratory analysis of pooled data from two Norwegian RCTs showed an increase in both cancer incidence and cancer death in patients treated with folic acid and vitamin B12 versus those receiving placebo or vitamin B6 alone. [54] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Breast Cancer Prevention; Colorectal Cancer Prevention; Lung Cancer Prevention; and Prostate Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nVitamin D has also generated interest as a potential anticancer agent. Sources of vitamin D include cutaneous synthesis upon exposure to sunlight, dietary intake, and supplements. Evidence for the efficacy of vitamin D supplements with or without calcium in preventing cancer incidence is available as a secondary endpoint from RCTs, with a summary of the results from three trials providing evidence of lack of efficacy. [55] A fourth RCT further corroborates this lack of cancer chemopreventive effect. [56] The overall body of experimental evidence from these studies in humans indicates that at the doses studied (range, 400–1,100 IU daily), vitamin D supplements do not reduce or increase the overall risk of cancer. [57,58] The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), a placebo-controlled trial of two forms of supplementation (2,000 IU/day of vitamin D and 1g/day of omega-3 fatty acids), found that neither type of supplementation resulted in lower incidence of invasive cancer. Because invasive cancer incidence was one of the primary endpoints of VITAL (with major cardiovascular events as the coprimary endpoint), the null results of VITAL provided strong additional evidence that even large doses of supplemental vitamin D have no discernible impact on cancer.\\n\\n[58,59,60,61] The VITAL findings concerning omega-3 fatty acids agree with those from a secondary analysis of cancer outcomes in a placebo-controlled RCT of aspirin/omega-3 fatty acid chemoprevention for cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus. [62]\\n\\nNone of the RCTs mentioned above studied multivitamin supplements as commonly taken by the general U.S. population; however, a separate arm of the PHS II directly studied this question. In the PHS II, 14,641 male physicians were randomly assigned to receive either a daily multivitamin supplement or a placebo for a median of 11 years. [63] Multivitamin supplements were associated with an 8% relative decrease in cancer incidence (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86–0.998; P = .04). The overall reduction in cancer risk was more pronounced in men who had been diagnosed with cancer before the study began (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.88) than in those with no history of cancer (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.87–1.03), suggesting that the small benefit of multivitamins in reducing overall cancer incidence largely stemmed from the prevention of second primary cancers. This puzzling result, along with the weak association and multiple statistical comparisons made for many different trial endpoints, diminishes the strength of evidence provided by the PHS II trial. Of note, no significant association between multivitamin use and total mortality was observed in the PHS II (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88–1.02; P = .13), suggesting neither a negative nor positive effect on life span. [64] This finding differs from the association between supplements and higher mortality reported in the observational Iowa Women's Health Study. [49]\\n\\nEnvironmental Exposures and Pollutants\", 'Environmental Exposures and Pollutants\\n\\nThe relationship between environmental pollutants and cancer risk has been of long-standing interest to researchers and the public. When estimates of the potential burden of cancer have been calculated for different classes of exposure, the factors described earlier, such as cigarette smoking and infections, have represented much greater proportions of the cancer burden than have environmental pollutants. Nevertheless, some associations between environmental pollutants and cancer have been clearly established. Perhaps because the lung is most heavily exposed to air pollutants, many of the most firmly established examples of pollutants and cancer relate specifically to lung cancer, including secondhand tobacco smoke, indoor radon, outdoor air pollution, and asbestos for mesothelioma. Another environmental pollutant linked with cancer is highly concentrated inorganic arsenic in drinking water, which is causally associated with cancers of the skin, bladder, and lung. Many other environmental pollutants, such as pesticides, have been assessed for risk with human cancer, but with indeterminate results. There are challenging methodological issues to address in these studies, such as accurately measuring exposures for long periods, which often make it difficult to clearly establish an association between an environmental pollutant and cancer.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThe list of topics considered above is not exhaustive. Other lifestyle and environmental factors known to affect cancer risk (either beneficially or detrimentally) include certain sexual and reproductive practices, the use of exogenous estrogens, and certain occupational and chemical exposures.\\n\\nIn this summary, factors were selected that appear to impact the risk of several types of cancer and that have been identified as being potentially modifiable. These include cigarette smoking, which has been conclusively linked with a wide range of malignancies; avoidance of cigarette smoking has been shown to reduce cancer incidence. Other potential modifiable cancer risk factors include alcohol consumption and obesity; physical activity is inversely associated with the risk of certain cancers. More research is needed to determine whether these associations are causal and whether avoiding risk behaviors or increasing protective behaviors would actually reduce cancer incidence.', 'Ambulatory Electrocardiogram (EKG) Test Overview An ambulatory electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) records the electrical activity of your heart while you do your usual activities. Ambulatory means that you are able to walk during the test. This type of monitoring may also be called ambulatory EKG, Holter monitoring, 24-hour EKG, or cardiac event monitoring.\\n\\nMany heart problems are noticeable only during certain activities. These include exercise, eating, sex, stress, bowel movements, and even sleeping. An ambulatory electrocardiogram is more likely to find abnormal heartbeats that occur during these activities.\\n\\nMany people have irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) from time to time. What this means depends on the type of pattern they produce, how often they occur, how long they last, and whether they occur at the same time you have symptoms. Because arrhythmias can come and go, it may be hard to record one while you are in the doctor\\'s office.\\n\\nThere are several different types of ambulatory monitors. Your doctor will choose the type that works best for you and is most likely to help diagnose your heart problem.\\n\\nAmbulatory EKG monitoring is done to:\\n\\nLook for and record irregular heartbeats that come and go or happen during certain activities.

If you have to do anything to send your heart data, your doctor will show you how.\\n\\nWhat you do during the test Your doctor may ask you to keep a diary of all of your activities and symptoms while you wear the monitor. You will write down the type of activity you were doing and the time your symptoms started. For example, write down the exact times when you:\\n\\nExercise or climb stairs. Eat. Urinate or have a bowel movement. Have sex. Sleep. Get upset. Take medicine. If you have any symptoms of heart problems, such as dizziness, fainting, chest pain, or abnormal heartbeats, push the event-marker button on the recorder to mark it (if you have the type that allows you to). Then write down the exact time and how long the symptom lasts. For example, you might write: \"12:30 p.m. Ate lunch. 1:00 p.m. Argument with boss, had chest tightness for several minutes.\"\\n\\nIf one of the electrodes or lead wires comes loose, a light on the monitor will flash. Press on the center of each electrode to see if you can restore the contact. Call your doctor if one of the electrodes comes off and you can\\'t get it to stay on.\\n\\nYour doctor will tell you if you need to stay away from strong electromagnetic fields while wearing a monitor. This may include magnets, microwave ovens, and electric blankets. Signals from these types of electronic equipment can sometimes affect the recording.\\n\\nWhat you and your doctor do after the test At the end of the recording period, your doctor will give you instructions. If you had electrode pads or a patch, you may go to the doctor\\'s office or hospital to have them removed. Or you may be able to remove them yourself. Your doctor will let you know how to return the monitor.\\n\\nYour doctor will review the data from your monitor. The doctor will also look at your records of activities and symptoms and the times they occurred. Your doctor will compare the timing of your activities and symptoms with the recorded heart pattern.', \"If you have electrodes or pads on your skin, those places may itch slightly during the test.

A CBC also helps him or her diagnose conditions, such as anemia, infection, and many other disorders.\\n\\nA CBC test usually includes:\\n\\nWhite blood cell (WBC, leukocyte) count. White blood cells protect the body against infection. If an infection develops, white blood cells attack and destroy the bacteria, virus, or other organism causing it.

The number of white blood cells is sometimes used to find an infection or to see how the body is dealing with cancer treatment.\\n\\nWhite blood cell types (WBC differential). The major types of white blood cells are neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Immature neutrophils, called band neutrophils, are also part of this test. Each type of cell plays a different role in protecting the body. The numbers of each one of these types of white blood cells give important information about the immune system. Too many or too few of the different types of white blood cells can help find an infection, an allergic or toxic reaction to medicines or chemicals, and many conditions, such as leukemia.\\n\\nRed blood cell (RBC) count. Red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. They also carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs so it can be exhaled. If the RBC count is low (anemia), the body may not be getting the oxygen it needs. If the count is too high (a condition called polycythemia), there's a chance that the red blood cells will clump together and block tiny blood vessels (capillaries). This also makes it hard for your red blood cells to carry oxygen.\\n\\nHematocrit (HCT, packed cell volume, PCV). This test measures the amount of space (volume) red blood cells take up in the blood. The value is given as a percentage of red blood cells in a volume of blood. For example, a hematocrit of 38 means that 38% of the blood's volume is made of red blood cells. Hematocrit and hemoglobin values are the two major tests that show if anemia or polycythemia is present.\\n\\nHemoglobin (Hgb). The hemoglobin molecule fills up the red blood cells. It carries oxygen and gives the blood cell its red color. The hemoglobin test measures the amount of hemoglobin in blood. It's a good measure of how well the blood can carry oxygen throughout the body.\\n\\nRed blood cell indices. There are three red blood cell indices: mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). They are measured by a machine, and their values come from other measurements in a CBC. The MCV shows the size of the red blood cells. The MCH value is the amount of hemoglobin in an average red blood cell. The MCHC measures the concentration of hemoglobin in an average red blood cell. These numbers help in the diagnosis of different types of anemia. Red cell distribution width (RDW) can also be measured. It shows if the cells are all the same or different sizes or shapes.\\n\\nPlatelet (thrombocyte) count. Platelets (thrombocytes) are the smallest type of blood cell. They are important in blood clotting. When bleeding occurs, the platelets swell, clump together, and form a sticky plug that helps stop the bleeding. If there are too few platelets, uncontrolled bleeding may be a problem. If there are too many platelets, there is a chance of a blood clot forming in a blood vessel. Also, platelets may be involved in hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).\", 'Mean platelet volume (MPV). Mean platelet volume measures the average amount (volume) of platelets. MPV is used along with platelet count to diagnose some diseases. If the platelet count is normal, the MPV can still be too high or too low.\\n\\nA CBC may be done as part of a regular physical exam. There are many other reasons that a doctor may want this blood test, including to:\\n\\nFind the cause of symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, fever, bruising, or weight loss. Check for anemia. See how much blood has been lost if there is bleeding. Diagnose polycythemia. Check for an infection. Diagnose diseases of the blood, such as leukemia. Check how the body is dealing with some types of drug or radiation treatment. Check how abnormal bleeding is affecting the blood cells and counts. Screen for high and low values before a surgery. See if there are too many or too few of certain types of cells. This may help find other conditions. For instance, too many eosinophils may be a sign of an allergy or asthma. A blood count can give valuable information about the general state of your health.', \"cabazitaxel Pronunciation: ka BAZ i TAX el\\n\\nBrand: Jevtana\\n\\nWhat is the most important information I should know about cabazitaxel?

Prediabetes is a warning sign that you are at risk for getting type 2 diabetes. It means that your blood sugar is higher than it should be, but not high enough to be diabetes. Prediabetes is also called impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose. Most people who get type 2 diabetes have prediabetes first.\\n\\nWhat causes prediabetes? The food you eat turns into sugar, which your body uses for energy. Normally, an organ called the pancreas makes insulin, which allows the sugar in your blood to get into your body's cells. But when your body can't use insulin the right way, the sugar doesn't move into cells. It stays in your blood instead. This is called insulin resistance. The buildup of sugar in the blood causes prediabetes.\\n\\nPeople who are overweight, aren't physically active, and have a family history of diabetes are more likely to get prediabetes. Women who have had gestational diabetes are also more likely to get prediabetes.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? Most people with prediabetes don't have any symptoms. But if you have prediabetes, you need to watch for signs of diabetes, such as:\\n\\nFeeling very thirsty. Urinating more often than usual. Feeling very hungry. Having blurred vision. Losing weight without trying. How is prediabetes diagnosed? A blood test can tell if you have prediabetes. You have prediabetes if:\\n\\nThe results of your hemoglobin A1c test are 5.7 percent to 6.4. The results of your fasting blood glucose test are between 100 and 125 milligrams per deciliter. The results of your oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) are 140 to 199 mg/dL (2 hours after the beginning of the test). How is it treated? The key to treating prediabetes and preventing type 2 diabetes is getting your blood sugar levels back to a normal range. You can do this by making some lifestyle changes.\\n\\nWatch your weight. If you are overweight, losing just a small amount of weight may help. Reducing fat around your waist is particularly important. Make healthy food choices. Limit the amount of unhealthy fat you eat, such as saturated fat and trans fat. Try to cut calories and limit sweets. Be active. You can do moderate activity, vigorous activity, or both. Bit by bit, increase the amount you do every day. You may want to swim, bike, or do other activities. Walking is an easy way to get exercise. Making these changes may help delay or prevent diabetes. You may also avoid or delay some of the serious problems that you can get when you have diabetes, such as heart attack, stroke, and heart, eye, nerve, and kidney disease.\\n\\nYou may need to take a diabetes medicine called metformin. It reduces the amount of sugar made by the liver in people who are insulin-resistant.\\n\\nCan prediabetes be prevented? Staying at a healthy weight, eating healthy foods, and getting regular exercise can help prevent prediabetes.\", \"What is heart failure? Heart failure means that your heart muscle doesn't pump as much blood as your body needs. Failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped. It means that your heart is not pumping as well as it should. Because your heart cannot pump well, your body tries to make up for it. To do this: Your body holds on to salt and water. This increases the amount of blood in your bloodstream. Your heart beats faster. Your heart may get bigger. Your body has an amazing ability to make up for heart failure. It may do such a good job that you don't know you have a disease. But at some point, your heart and body will no longer be able to keep up. Then fluid starts to build up in your body, and you have symptoms like feeling weak and out of breath. This fluid buildup is called congestion. It's why some doctors call the disease congestive heart failure. Heart failure usually gets worse over time. But treatment can slow the disease and help you feel better and live longer. What causes heart failure? Anything that damages your heart or affects how well it pumps can lead to heart failure. Common causes of heart failure are: High blood pressure. Heart attack. Coronary artery disease. Other conditions that can lead to heart failure include: Diabetes. Diseases of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathies). Heart valve disease. Disease of the sac around the heart (pericardial disease), such as pericarditis. A slow, fast, or uneven heart rhythm (arrhythmia).\\n\\nA heart problem that you were born with (congenital heart defect). Long-term heavy alcohol use, which can damage your heart. What are the symptoms? Symptoms of heart failure start to happen when your heart cannot pump enough blood to the rest of your body. In the early stages, you may: Feel tired easily. Be short of breath when you exert yourself. Feel like your heart is pounding or racing (palpitations). Feel weak or dizzy. As heart failure gets worse, fluid starts to build up in your lungs and other parts of your body. This may cause you to: Feel short of breath even at rest. Have swelling (edema), especially in your legs, ankles, and feet. Gain weight. This may happen over just a day or two, or more slowly. Cough or wheeze, especially when you lie down. Feel bloated or sick to your stomach. If your symptoms suddenly get worse, you will need emergency care. How is heart failure diagnosed? Your doctor may diagnose heart failure based on your symptoms and a physical exam. But you will need tests to find the cause and type of heart failure so that you can get the right treatment. These tests may include: Blood tests. A chest X-ray. An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) to check your heart's electrical system. An echocardiogram to see the size and shape of your heart and how well it is pumping. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to see the structure of your heart and check how well it is pumping.\", \"Echocardiogram An echocardiogram can help show if you have heart failure, what type it is, and what is causing it. Your doctor can also use it to see if your heart failure is getting worse. This test can measure how much blood your heart pumps to your body. This measurement is called the ejection fraction. If your ejection fraction gets lower and you are having more symptoms, it means that your heart failure is getting worse. How is it treated? Most people with heart failure need to take several medicines. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to: Help keep heart failure from getting worse. These drugs include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, and vasodilators like hydralazine and a nitrate. Reduce symptoms so you feel better. These drugs include diuretics (water pills) and digoxin. Treat the cause of your heart failure. It is very important to take your medicines exactly as your doctor tells you to. If you don't, your heart failure could get worse. Pacemaker or defibrillator A pacemaker or a defibrillator (such as an ICD) may be an option for you if you have a problem with your heart rhythm. A pacemaker can help your heart pump blood better. A defibrillator can prevent a dangerous heart-rhythm problem. Care at home Lifestyle changes are an important part of treatment. They can help slow down heart failure.\\n\\nThey may also help control other diseases that make heart failure worse, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. The best steps you can take are to: Eat less sodium. Sodium causes your body to hold on to water and may make symptoms worse. Your doctor may also ask you to limit how much fluid you drink. Get regular exercise. Your doctor can tell you what level of exercise is safe for you, how to check your pulse, and how to know if you are doing too much. Take rest breaks during the day. Lose weight if you are overweight. Even a few pounds can make a difference. Stop smoking. Smoking damages your heart and makes exercise harder to do. Limit alcohol. Ask your doctor how much, if any, is safe. Ask your doctor if cardiac rehab is right for you. Rehab can give you education and support that help you learn self-care and build new healthy habits, such as exercise and healthy eating. To stay as healthy as possible, work closely with your doctor. Have all your tests, and go to all your appointments. It is also important to: Talk to your doctor before you take any new medicine, including nonprescription and prescription drugs, vitamins, and herbs. Some of them may make your heart failure worse. Keep track of your symptoms. Weigh yourself at the same time every day, and write down your weight. Call your doctor if you have a sudden weight gain, a change in your ability to exercise, or any sudden change in your symptoms.\\n\\nWhat can you expect if you have heart failure? Medicines and lifestyle changes can slow or even reverse heart failure for some people. But heart failure often gets worse over time. Early on, your symptoms may not be too bad. As heart failure gets worse, you may need to limit your activities. Treatment can often help reduce symptoms, but it usually doesn't get rid of them. Heart failure can also lead to other health problems. These may include: Trouble with your heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Stroke. Heart attack. Mitral valve regurgitation. Blood clots in your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs (pulmonary embolism). Your doctor may be able to give you medicine or other treatment to prevent or treat these problems. Heart failure can get worse suddenly. If this happens, you will need emergency care. To prevent sudden heart failure, you need to avoid things that can trigger it. These include eating too much salt, missing a dose of your medicine, and exercising too hard. Knowing that your health may get worse can be hard. It is normal to sometimes feel sad or hopeless. But if these feelings last, talk to your doctor. Antidepressant medicines, counseling, or both may help you cope.\", 'What is Sjögren\\'s syndrome? Sjögren\\'s syndrome (say \"SHOH-grins\") is a disease in which the immune system attacks the glands that make moisture for the body, such as tears and saliva. The damage keeps the glands from working the way they should and makes your eyes and mouth dry.\\n\\nThe disease may also cause other problems, such as fatigue and pain in the joints. In rare cases, it can damage the lungs, kidneys, and nerves.\\n\\nAnyone can get Sjögren\\'s, but it\\'s most common in white women who are in their 40s and 50s.\\n\\nWhat causes Sjögren\\'s syndrome?

It may also occur along with other health problems, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or scleroderma.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? The most common symptoms of Sjögren\\'s syndrome are very dry eyes and mouth that last for at least 3 months and are not caused by medicines. You may have itching and burning in your eyes. Your mouth may feel very dry, as though it is full of cotton. It can also cause dryness in your skin, lungs, and vagina and lower your energy level.\\n\\nHow is Sjögren\\'s syndrome diagnosed? Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask questions about your symptoms and past health. He or she will also ask about any medicines you\\'re taking that could cause dry eyes and mouth. If needed, you may also have tests to:\\n\\nMeasure tear flow. Measure saliva. Check for antibodies in your blood. How is it treated? Your treatment for Sjögren\\'s syndrome will depend on how the disease affects you over time. In most cases, treatment will focus on helping you control your symptoms.\\n\\nYour doctor may recommend or prescribe:\\n\\nArtificial teardrops, mouth lubricants, and saliva substitutes to help moisten your eyes, mouth, and throat. Estrogen creams, for vaginal dryness. Acetaminophen, such as Tylenol, may be helpful for muscle and joint pain.

Ciprofloxacin should be used only for infections that cannot be treated with a safer antibiotic.\\n\\nCiprofloxacin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.', 'Living with pain can be hard, especially if it\\'s long-term—or chronic—pain. Chronic pain is pain that lasts for 3 months or longer. It can make you sleep poorly, feel tired and irritable, and have a hard time being active or working. It may strain your relationships with loved ones too, making it hard to be the kind of friend, parent, or partner you want to be. You may feel stressed or get depressed or anxious. And these feelings may make your pain worse, because they can make it harder to manage your pain.\\n\\nLearning how to control your pain can help with all of these things. In most cases, chronic pain can be managed so that you can get on with your life and do your daily activities. One way you can help manage and cope with your pain is through healthy thinking. Your thoughts are something you can control. You can learn techniques to make your thoughts more helpful and encouraging.\\n\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy, also called CBT, is a way to help you stay well and cope with pain by changing how you think. And how you think affects how you feel. Negative thoughts can make stress and pain worse. Healthy thinking can help. CBT is often used to help people think in a healthier, more balanced way. The goal is to change the way you think about pain so that your body and mind respond better when you have pain. Another technique, called acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), helps you cope with chronic pain by helping you learn to accept negative feelings. You learn to base your choices and actions on your personal values, rather than on negative feelings. Healthy thinking can take away barriers to being physically active, such as discouraging thoughts. This helps because pain can also improve with physical activity, such as walking and swimming. Changing your thinking will take some time. Be patient with yourself as you learn healthy thinking. It may not feel right at first, because you are trying out something new. But with daily practice, it will get easier and feel more natural. And it\\'s something you can start doing today. Many people work with a therapist or a counselor to learn CBT techniques. But you also can practice some of them on your own.\\n\\nWorking on your own or with a counselor, you can practice these three steps:\\n\\nStop. Notice your thoughts. When you notice a negative thought, stop it in its tracks and write it down. Ask. Look at that thought and ask yourself whether it is helpful or unhelpful. Choose. Choose a new, helpful thought to replace a negative one. Ask yourself: What effect does believing this thought have on me? What might happen if I tried to believe the more healthy thought? The goal is to have encouraging thoughts come naturally. It may take some time to change the way you think. You will need to practice healthy thinking every day.\\n\\nNotice and stop your thoughts The first step is to notice and stop your negative thoughts or \"self-talk.\" Self-talk is what you think and believe about yourself and your experiences. It\\'s like a running commentary in your head. Your self-talk may be rational and helpful. Or it may be negative and not helpful.\\n\\nAsk about your thoughts The next step is to ask yourself whether your thoughts are helpful or unhelpful. Does the evidence support your negative thought? Some of your self-talk may be true. Or it may be partly true but exaggerated. Here are a few types of unhelpful thoughts to look for:', 'Focusing on the negative: This is sometimes called filtering. You filter out the good and focus only on the bad. Example: \"I\\'ve had some good days, but having one good day doesn\\'t mean that I will have more.\" Reality: Just like life, not all days are good. But that doesn\\'t mean every day will be bad. Having pain-free days means that you are capable of having them, and more lie ahead. Should: People sometimes have set ideas about how they \"should\" act. If you hear yourself saying that you or other people \"should,\" \"ought to,\" or \"have to\" do something, then you might be setting yourself up to feel bad. Example: \"If I take all my medicines as prescribed, then I should have no pain.\" Reality: There\\'s nothing wrong with expecting that medicines should work. But managing chronic pain sometimes takes many different resources, including medicines, to get the best results. Overgeneralizing: This is taking one example and saying it\\'s true for everything. Look for words such as \"never\" and \"always.\" Example: \"There\\'s nothing I can do to help the pain.\" Reality: On some days, pain may seem overwhelming. But dwelling on that causes you to focus on the pain, which can make it worse. Instead, try to focus on ways you can work with the pain. What was different in previous times when the pain wasn\\'t so consuming? How did you cope then? Can some of those strategies help? All-or-nothing thinking: This is also called black-or-white thinking.\\n\\nExample: \"I have a hard time sitting for very long, so I can\\'t go back to work.\" Reality: With some creative thinking, you may be able to work out an alternative seating arrangement or a flexible work schedule. Choose your thoughts The next step is to choose a more helpful thought to replace the unhelpful one.\\n\\nKeeping a journal of your thoughts is one of the best ways to practice stopping, asking, and choosing your thoughts. It makes you aware of your self-talk. Write down any negative or unhelpful thoughts you had during the day. If you think you might not remember at the end of your day, keep a notepad with you so you can write down any unhelpful thoughts as they happen. Then write down a helpful message to correct the unhelpful thought.\\n\\nWith daily practice, more accurate and helpful thoughts will soon come naturally to you.\\n\\nBut there may be some truth in some of your negative thoughts. You may have some things you want to work on. If you didn\\'t perform as well as you would like on something, write that down. You can work on a plan to correct or improve that area.\\n\\nIf you want, you also could write down what kind of unhelpful thought you had.', 'Planning to Be More Active When You Have Chronic Disease\\n\\nUse this sheet to list what you enjoy and what is hard for you.

Osteoarthritis is a painful problem with the joints. Healthy joints help your body move, bend, and twist. Knees glide up and down stairs without creaking or crunching. Hips move you along on a walk without a complaint. But when you have arthritis, such simple, everyday movements can hurt. Using the stairs can be painful. Walking a few steps, opening a door, and even combing your hair can be hard.\\n\\nArthritis is mainly a disease of the spine, hip, hand, knee, and foot. But it can happen in other joints too. A joint is where two bones connect. And you have them all over your body.\\n\\nArthritis is most common in older people. Even though you can't cure arthritis, there are many treatments that can help with your pain and make it easier for you to move. And you can do things to keep the damage from getting worse.\\n\\nWhat causes osteoarthritis? The simplest way to describe arthritis is that it's wear and tear on the cartilage of your joints. This cushioning tissue is firm, thick, and slippery. It covers and protects the ends of bones where they meet to form a joint.\\n\\nWith arthritis, there are changes in the cartilage that cause it to break down. When it breaks down, the bones rub together and cause damage and pain. Experts don't know why this breakdown in cartilage happens. But aging, joint injury, being overweight, and genetics may be a part of the reason.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? Pain. Your joints may ache, or the pain may feel burning or sharp. Stiffness. Getting up in the morning can be hard. Your joints may feel stiff and creaky for a short time, until you get moving. Muscle weakness. The muscles around the joint may get weaker. This happens a lot with arthritis in the knee. Deformed joints. Joints can start to look like they are the wrong shape, especially as arthritis gets worse. Reduced range of motion and loss of use of the joint. As your arthritis gets worse, you may not be able to fully bend, flex, or extend your joints. Or you may not be able to use them at all. Cracking and creaking. Your joints may make crunching, creaking sounds. How is osteoarthritis diagnosed? Your doctor will check that your pain is not caused by another problem. He or she will ask questions about your symptoms, such as:\\n\\nIs the pain burning, aching, or sharp? Are your joints stiff in the morning? If yes, how long does the stiffness last? Do you have any joint swelling? If your joints are tender and swollen and the muscles are weak, this will also help your doctor confirm whether you have arthritis. You may also have X-rays to check your joints for damage. Your doctor may want to do blood tests or other tests to see if there are other causes for your pain.\\n\\nHow is it treated? There are many treatments for arthritis, but what works for someone else may not help you. Work with your doctor to find what is best for you. Often a mix of things helps the most.\\n\\nYour treatment may include:\", \"Your treatment may include:\\n\\nUsing pain medicine. If your pain is mild, over-the-counter pain medicines such as acetaminophen (for example, Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help.

Influenza (flu) is a viral infection. People often use the term \"flu\" to describe any kind of mild illness, such as a cold or a stomach virus, that has symptoms like the flu. But the real flu is different. Flu symptoms are usually worse than a cold and last longer. The flu usually does not cause vomiting or diarrhea in adults.\\n\\nMost flu outbreaks happen in late fall and winter. Because symptoms may not start for a couple of days, you may pass the flu to someone before you know you have it.\\n\\nWhat causes the flu? The flu is usually caused by influenza viruses A and B. There are different strains of the flu virus every year.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? The flu causes a fever, body aches, a headache, a dry cough, and a sore or dry throat. You will probably feel tired and less hungry than usual. The symptoms usually are the worst for the first 3 or 4 days. But it can take 1 to 2 weeks to get completely better.\\n\\nIt usually takes 1 to 4 days to get symptoms of the flu after you have been around someone who has the virus.\\n\\nMost people get better without problems. But sometimes the flu can lead to a bacterial infection, such as an ear infection, a sinus infection, or bronchitis. Less often, the flu may cause a more serious problem, such as pneumonia.\\n\\nCertain people are at higher risk of problems from the flu. They include young children, pregnant women, older adults, and people with long-term illnesses or with impaired immune systems that make it hard to fight infection.\\n\\nHow is the flu diagnosed? Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and examine you. This usually gives the doctor enough information to find out if you have the flu, especially if many cases of a similar illness have occurred in the area and the local health department reports a flu outbreak.\\n\\nIn some cases, the doctor may do a blood test or take a sample of fluid from your nose or throat to find out what type of flu virus you have.\\n\\nHow is it treated? Most people can treat flu symptoms at home. Home treatment includes resting, drinking plenty of fluids, and taking medicine to lower your fever. But some people need to go to the hospital for treatment. They may have severe symptoms or get pneumonia. Or the flu infection may make an existing health problem worse.\\n\\nIf you think you have the flu, your doctor may be able to give you medicine that can make the symptoms milder. It\\'s best to start taking it within 2 days of your first symptoms.\\n\\nCan the flu be prevented? You can help prevent the flu by getting the flu vaccine every year. It\\'s best to get the vaccine as soon as it\\'s available.\\n\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months old and older should get a flu vaccine. The vaccine is especially important for people who are at higher risk of problems from the flu, including:\\n\\nYoung children. Adults ages 50 and older. Adults and children who have long-term health problems or an impaired immune system. Women who will be pregnant during the flu season. The flu vaccine is also important for health care workers and anyone who lives or works with a person who is at higher risk of problems from the flu.\\n\\nThe vaccine usually prevents most cases of the flu. But even if you do get the flu after you\\'ve had the vaccine, your symptoms will be milder and you\\'ll have less chance of problems from the flu. You cannot get the flu from the flu vaccine.', \"Breathing Problems: Using a Metered-Dose Inhaler Using a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer (child) Using a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer (adult) Using a metered-dose inhaler without a spacer Introduction Diseases affecting the lungs—such as asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)—share many of the same medicines. These medicines are often delivered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI).\\n\\nUsing an MDI:\\n\\nDelivers most of a measured dose of medicine directly to your lungs. Can help keep your symptoms under control and minimize long-term damage to your lungs. May prevent or reduce side effects of the medicine. May let you use less medicine than is found in a pill but get the same effect. May result in the medicine working faster than a pill form.\\n\\nHow to use a metered-dose inhaler Getting started Talk with your doctor to be sure that you are using your MDI correctly. It might help if you practice using it in front of a mirror. Use the inhaler exactly as your doctor has prescribed. Check that you have the correct medicine. If you use several inhalers, put a label on each one so that you know which one to use at the right time. Check how much medicine is in the inhaler. Check the label of your inhaler medicine to see how many inhalations should be in the canister. If you know how many breaths you can take, you can replace your inhaler before you run out. Learn how to test your canister to estimate how much medicine is left. Your doctor or pharmacist can help you with this. Use a spacer if you have problems getting the correct timing when you use an inhaler or if you are using steroid medicine. Using an MDI Using a spacer with an MDI is the most efficient way to get the most medicine to your lungs. Make sure you understand the proper use of an:\\n\\nMDI with a spacer for a child. MDI with a spacer for an adult. Although using an MDI with a spacer is usually recommended, you can also use an MDI without a spacer. Learn the proper use of an:\\n\\nMDI without a spacer for an adult or child. If you are inhaling steroid medicine, rinse your mouth out with water after use. Don't swallow the water. Swallowing the water will increase the chance that the medicine will get into your bloodstream. This may increase the side effects of the medicine.\\n\\nSome liquid may build up on the inhaler, but you may not need to clean the inhaler every day. Follow the directions for how and how often to clean the type of MDI you have.\", 'COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) Chronic bronchitis Airways Inside the Lungs Emphysema Cardiovascular system Using a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer (adult) Lung Transplant Topic Overview What is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? COPD is a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. It is caused by damage to the lungs over many years, usually from smoking.\\n\\nCOPD is often a mix of two diseases:\\n\\nChronic bronchitis (say \"bron-KY-tus\"). In chronic bronchitis, the airways that carry air to the lungs (bronchial tubes) get inflamed and make a lot of mucus. This can narrow or block the airways, making it hard for you to breathe. Emphysema (say \"em-fuh-ZEE-muh\"). In a healthy person, the tiny air sacs in the lungs are like balloons. As you breathe in and out, they get bigger and smaller to move air through your lungs. But with emphysema, these air sacs are damaged and lose their stretch. Less air gets in and out of the lungs, which makes you feel short of breath. COPD gets worse over time. You can\\'t undo the damage to your lungs. But you can take steps to prevent more damage and to feel better.\\n\\nWhat causes COPD? COPD is almost always caused by smoking. Over time, breathing tobacco smoke irritates the airways and destroys the stretchy fibers in the lungs.\\n\\nOther things that may put you at risk include breathing chemical fumes, dust, or air pollution over a long period of time. Secondhand smoke also may damage the lungs.\\n\\nIt usually takes many years for the lung damage to start causing symptoms, so COPD is most common in people who are older than 60.\\n\\nYou may be more likely to get COPD if you had a lot of serious lung infections when you were a child. People who get emphysema in their 30s or 40s may have a disorder that runs in families, called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. But this is rare.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms?\\n\\nThe main symptoms are:\\n\\nA long-lasting (chronic) cough. Mucus that comes up when you cough. Shortness of breath that gets worse when you exercise. As COPD gets worse, you may be short of breath even when you do simple things like get dressed or fix a meal. It gets harder to eat or exercise, and breathing takes much more energy. People often lose weight and get weaker.\\n\\nAt times, your symptoms may suddenly flare up and get much worse. This is called a COPD exacerbation (say \"egg-ZASS-er-BAY-shun\"). An exacerbation can range from mild to life-threatening. The longer you have COPD, the more severe these flare-ups will be.\\n\\nHow is COPD diagnosed? To find out if you have COPD, a doctor will:\\n\\nDo a physical exam and listen to your lungs. Ask you questions about your past health and whether you smoke or have been exposed to other things that can irritate your lungs. Have you do breathing tests, including spirometry, to find out how well your lungs work. Do chest X-rays and other tests to help rule out other problems that could be causing your symptoms. Do an Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) blood test. AAT is a protein your body makes that helps protect the lungs. People who have a low AAT are more likely to get emphysema. This test only needs to be done once. If there is a chance you could have COPD, it is very important to find out as soon as you can. This gives you time to take steps to slow the damage to your lungs.\\n\\nHow is it treated? The best way to slow COPD is to quit smoking. This is the most important thing you can do. It is never too late to quit. No matter how long you have smoked or how serious your COPD is, quitting smoking can help stop the damage to your lungs.\\n\\nYour doctor can prescribe treatments that may help you manage your symptoms and feel better.', \"Your doctor can prescribe treatments that may help you manage your symptoms and feel better.\\n\\nMedicines can help you breathe easier. Most of them are inhaled so they go straight to your lungs. If you get an inhaler, it is very important to use it just the way your health provider shows you. A lung (pulmonary) rehab program can help you learn to manage your disease. A team of health professionals can provide counseling and teach you how to breathe easier, exercise, and eat well. In time, you may need to use oxygen some or most of the time. People who have COPD are more likely to get lung infections, so you will need to get a flu vaccine every year. You should also get a pneumococcal shot. It may not keep you from getting pneumonia. But if you do get pneumonia, you probably won't be as sick.\\n\\nHow can you live well with COPD? There are many things you can do at home to stay as healthy as you can.\\n\\nAvoid things that can irritate your lungs, such as smoke and air pollution. Use an air filter in your home. Get regular exercise to stay as strong as you can. Eat well so you can keep up your strength. If you are losing weight, ask your doctor or dietitian about ways to make it easier to get the calories you need. Dealing with flare-ups: As COPD gets worse, you may have flare-ups when your symptoms quickly get worse and stay worse. It is important to know what to do if this happens. Your doctor may give you an action plan and medicines to help you breathe if you have a flare-up. But if the attack is severe, you may need to go to the emergency room or call 911.\\n\\nManaging depression and anxiety: Knowing that you have a disease that gets worse over time can be hard. It's common to feel sad or hopeless sometimes. Having trouble breathing can also make you feel very anxious. If these feelings last, be sure to tell your doctor. Counseling, medicine, and support groups can help you cope.\", \"Gallstones: Should I Have Gallbladder Surgery?

Don't have surgery. Wait and see if you have another attack. Key points to remember If you feel comfortable managing mild and infrequent gallstone attacks, and if your doctor thinks that you aren't likely to have serious complications, it's okay not to have surgery. Most doctors recommend surgery if you have had repeated attacks. If you have had one attack of gallstone pain, you may want to wait to see whether you have more. Surgery is the best way to prevent gallstone attacks. The surgery is very common, so doctors have a lot of experience with it. Your body will work fine without a gallbladder. There may be small changes in how you digest food, but you probably won't notice them. FAQs What are gallstones? Gallstones are stones made of cholesterol and other things found in bile. They form in the gallbladder or bile duct. They may be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball.\\n\\nMost people with gallstones have no symptoms and don't need treatment. Those who do have symptoms often have surgery to remove the gallbladder.\\n\\nIn people who do have symptoms, the most common one is pain in the upper right area of your belly. Other symptoms include nausea and vomiting.\\n\\nSymptoms usually don't come back after the gallbladder has been removed.\\n\\nIf gallstones block a duct, you may get jaundice. Jaundice makes your skin and the whites of your eyes yellow. It can also cause dark urine and light-colored stools.\\n\\nWhat is the surgery to remove the gallbladder? Laparoscopic gallbladder surgery is the most common surgery done to remove the gallbladder. The doctor inserts a lighted viewing instrument called a laparoscope and surgical tools into your belly through several small cuts. This type of surgery is very safe. People who have it usually recover enough in 7 to 10 days to go back to work or to their normal routine.\\n\\nOpen gallbladder surgery involves taking the gallbladder out through one larger incision in your belly. Open surgery may be done if laparoscopic surgery is not an option or when problems are found during laparoscopic surgery. The hospital stay is longer with open surgery.\\n\\nStones in the bile duct\\n\\nIf gallstones are found in the common bile duct before or during surgery to remove the gallbladder, a doctor may do a procedure called an ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram). This involves putting a tube called an endoscope down your throat to your small intestine. The doctor uses the scope to look for stones in the duct and remove them.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of gallbladder surgery? The overall risk from laparoscopic gallbladder surgery is very low. The most serious risks include:\\n\\nInfection. Bleeding. Injury to the common bile duct. Injury to the small intestine by one of the tools used during surgery. Risks from open gallbladder surgery include:\\n\\nInjury to the common bile duct. Bleeding. Infection. Injuries to the liver, intestines, or major blood vessels in the belly. Blood clots or pneumonia related to the longer recovery period after open surgery. Both surgeries have the risks of general anesthesia.\\n\\nPostcholecystectomy syndrome\\n\\nAfter gallbladder surgery (cholecystectomy), a few people have ongoing symptoms, such as belly pain, bloating, gas, or diarrhea. This is called postcholecystectomy syndrome. These symptoms can be treated with medicines.\", 'Caregiver Support: Talking About Advance Care Planning Topic Overview When your loved one is diagnosed with a life-limiting illness, it is important to keep communication as clear and direct as possible.

If you have a wood-burning stove, try to use one that is airtight and does not leak smoke into your home.\", 'Controlling Indoor Mold Topic Overview Mold can get into a building through open doorways, windows, vents, and heating and air conditioning systems. Mold in the air outside can also attach itself to clothing, shoes, bags, and pets and can be carried indoors. Mold will grow in places that have a lot of moisture, such as around leaky roofs, windows, or pipes, or flooded areas. Mold grows well on paper products, cardboard, ceiling tiles, and wood products. Mold can also grow in dust, paints, wallpaper, insulation, drywall, carpet, and fabrics.\\n\\nIndoor mold (fungus) is very common in humid areas and in homes that have damp areas such as basements. Mold may trigger asthma symptoms, such as wheezing or coughing, or another allergic reaction, such as the rash of atopic dermatitis or stuffy nose of allergic rhinitis. Substances that trigger these reactions are called allergens.\\n\\nAlthough there is no strong evidence that reducing damp areas in homes or limiting exposure to them helps reduce allergy and asthma symptoms, taking the following steps may help keep mold out of the house or limit its growth.\\n\\nClean bathroom surfaces with soap and water, mold-killing products, or liquid bleach mixed with water. If you have mold in your home, remove it with one of these methods. Use bleach with caution, because it may irritate your nose. Keep the house aired out and dry. This may be difficult in some seasons and some climates. Use an exhaust fan in bathrooms and the kitchen to vent excess moisture. Make sure your clothes dryer vents moist air to the outside. Use a dehumidifier or air conditioner during humid weather. Try to keep the humidity in the home below 50%. Molds thrive in higher humidity. You can use a moisture or humidity meter to find out how humid it is in your home. Many hardware stores sell this device. Seal off or avoid damp areas, such as crawl spaces, attics, or basements. Use a dehumidifier to control mold growth in these areas. Try to avoid materials that have been stored in these areas. Remove carpeting from rooms that may have a lot of moisture, such as the bathroom and basement. Repair any water-damaged areas from leaking roofs or basements. Also, check the areas under sinks and around other plumbing for leaks. These areas can be prime mold-growing areas. Inspect closets for items, such as shoes, that may retain moisture. Add a mold inhibitor product to paint that you use in the home. Store fireplace wood outside the home.\\n\\nAdults spend one-third of their time and children spend half of their time in their bedrooms, so it is important that you take steps to prevent allergens in this room.', \"Asthma: Taking Charge of Your Asthma Introduction During an asthma attack, the airways swell and narrow.

There are three zones: green, yellow, and red. Your action plan tells you what to do when you are in each zone.\\n\\nCheck your symptoms or your peak flow, or both, on a regular basis, and use your action plan to see what zone you are in. If you have yellow zone symptoms or if your peak flow drops below 80% of your personal best measurement, follow your action plan. To figure out what 80% of your personal best measurement is, multiply your personal best measurement by 0.80. For example, if your personal best peak flow is 400, then 80% of that is 400 times 0.80, which is 320. To figure what 50% of your personal best peak flow is, multiply your personal best measurement by 0.50.\\n\\nGreen means Go. You are in the green zone if your peak flow is 80% to 100% of your personal best measurement.\\n\\nThis is where you want to be. Keep taking your daily asthma medicines as prescribed.\\n\\nYellow means Caution. You are in the yellow zone if your peak flow is 50% to 79% of your personal best measurement.

If you use a peak flow meter, write down your peak flow readings in your asthma diary [PDF] . Check your peak flow if your doctor recommends it Use your peak flow meter. This is a good way to check how well your lungs are working, which is called lung function. Your lung function can get worse without causing symptoms. Check your peak flow as often as your doctor tells you to. For many people this is twice a day, morning and evening. If you have trouble using your meter, talk with your doctor. See your doctor to review your plan Keep your regular follow-up appointments. During checkups, your doctor will ask if your symptoms or your peak flow, or both, have held steady, improved, or gotten worse.

Treatment can help you stay as active as possible. And it will help you understand that some continued or repeated back pain is not surprising or dangerous.\\n\\nMost low back pain can get better if you stay active, avoid positions and activities that may increase or cause back pain, use ice, and take nonprescription pain relievers when you need them.\\n\\nWhen you no longer have acute pain, you may be ready for gentle strengthening exercises for your stomach, back, and legs, and perhaps for some stretching exercises. Exercise may not only help decrease low back pain, but it may also help you recover faster, prevent reinjury to your back, and reduce the risk of disability from back pain.\\n\\nExercises to reduce low back pain are not complicated and can be done at home without any special equipment.\\n\\nIt's important that you don't let fear of pain keep you from trying gentle activity. You should try to be active soon after noticing pain, and gradually increase your activity level. Too little activity can lead to loss of flexibility, strength, and endurance, and then to more pain.\\n\\nHow do I exercise to reduce low back pain?\\n\\nMost people who have back pain naturally feel better by doing certain motions. Some feel better sitting (their back and hips are flexed). Others feel better standing (back and hips are extended). Exercise that moves you toward your more comfortable position is usually more successful in treating your back pain.footnote1 For example, if you are more comfortable sitting down, exercises that bend you forward—such as partial sit-ups (curl-ups) and knee-to-chest exercises—may help you.\\n\\nTalk to your doctor before you start an exercise program, and only do exercises that do not increase your symptoms.\\n\\nThe most effective exercise programs for chronic low back pain are designed specifically for you and are supervised.footnote2 For example, a physical therapist might teach you an exercise program that you can use at home. Then you would see the therapist every so often to check on your progress and advance your program.\\n\\nTalk to your doctor or physical therapist if you are unsure how to do these exercises or if you feel any pain when you are doing the exercises.\\n\\nTry to exercise a little bit every day.\\n\\nGet some type of aerobic exercise, such as walking, every day.

The glands (lymph nodes) on either side of the neck, under the jaw, or behind the ears commonly swell when you have a cold or sore throat.\\n\\nMore serious infections may cause the glands to enlarge and become very firm and tender. Glands can also swelland become tender after an injury, such as a cut or bite, or when a tumor or infection occurs in the mouth, head, or neck.\\n\\nSwollen glands and other lumps under the skin can be caused by many different things, including illness, infection, or another cause.\\n\\nInfections Swollen glands commonly develop when the body fights infections from colds, insect bites, or small cuts. More serious infections may cause the glands to enlarge and become firm, hard, or tender. Examples of such infections include:\\n\\nBacterial infections, such as: Strep throat, caused by the streptococcus bacterium. A boil (abscess), similar to a large pimple. A boil may develop when a hair follicle or the skin becomes infected. A sweat gland abscess may form one or more lumps in the armpit that look like boils. Viral infections, such as: A viral infection of the skin (molluscum contagiosum), which causes small pearly or flesh-colored bumps. Measles, rubella, chickenpox, or mumps. AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), which develops in the late stage of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection. This virus attacks the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight off infection and some diseases. Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus) or cytomegalovirus (CMV). These viruses cause fever, sore throat, and fatigue. Other infections, such as: Lyme disease, an infection that is spread by certain types of ticks. Syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection. Noncancerous (benign) growths Types of noncancerous (benign) growths, which are usually harmless, include:\\n\\nA lipoma, a smooth, rubbery, dome-shaped lump that is easily movable under the skin. A cyst, a sac of fluid and debris that sometimes hurts. Cystic lesions from acne are large pimples that occur deep under the skin. Branchial cleft cysts are found in the neck and do not usually cause problems unless they become infected. These cysts are most common in teenagers. An epidermal cyst often appears on the scalp, ears, face, or back. A ganglion is a soft, rubbery lump (a type of cyst) on the front or back of the wrist. Tonsillitis, which may also cause swelling in the neck. A salivary gland problem, such as inflammation, a salivary stone, an infection, or a tumor. An inflammation of fatty tissue under the skin (erythema nodosum) or overgrown scar tissue (keloid). Hernias, aneurysms, or nodules Hernias or aneurysms are bulging sections in a muscle or blood vessel. A nodule is usually a growth on a gland. A hernia, aneurysm, or nodule may be felt under the skin but may not be visible. These types of lumps may need more medical evaluation.\\n\\nAn inguinal hernia is a soft lump in the groin or near the navel. It may be more visible when you cough. Hernias that disappear when you press on them may not need any treatment. Hernias that don't disappear when you press on them may be more serious and need medical treatment. A bulging section in the wall of a blood vessel (aneurysm) may feel like a pulsating lump in the abdomen, in the groin, or behind the knee. It can cause serious problems if it involves the blood vessels in the brain or the abdomen. Aneurysms may be a medical emergency and may require immediate evaluation. A thyroid nodule is an abnormal growth on the thyroid gland. An enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) is in the neck just below the Adam's apple. Swelling caused by cancer A lump caused by cancer is usually hard, irregularly shaped, and firmly fixed under the skin or deep in tissue. Although they usually do not cause pain, some types of cancerous lumps are painful. Most lumps are not caused by cancer.\", 'Other causes Swelling may also be caused by:\\n\\nA side effect of a medicine, such as phenytoin (Dilantin). Other medical conditions and diseases, such as lupus, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Dizziness: Lightheadedness and Vertigo Digestive System Taking a pulse (Heart Rate) Topic Overview Dizziness is a word that is often used to describe two different feelings. It is important to know exactly what you mean when you say \"I feel dizzy,\" because it can help you and your doctor narrow down the list of possible problems.\\n\\nLightheadedness is a feeling that you are about to faint or \"pass out.\" Although you may feel dizzy, you do not feel as though you or your surroundings are moving. Lightheadedness often goes away or improves when you lie down. If lightheadedness gets worse, it can lead to a feeling of almost fainting or a fainting spell (syncope). You may sometimes feel nauseated or vomit when you are lightheaded. Vertigo is a feeling that you or your surroundings are moving when there is no actual movement. You may feel as though you are off balance, spinning, whirling, falling, or tilting. When you have severe vertigo, you may feel very nauseated or vomit. You may have trouble walking or standing, and you may lose your balance and fall. Although dizziness can occur in people of any age, it is more common among older adults. A fear of dizziness can cause older adults to limit their physical and social activities. Dizziness can also lead to falls and other injuries.\\n\\nLightheadedness It is common to feel lightheaded from time to time. Brief episodes of lightheadedness are not usually the result of a serious problem. Lightheadedness often is caused by a momentary drop in blood pressure and blood flow to your head that occurs when you get up too quickly from a seated or lying position (orthostatic hypotension). Ongoing lightheadedness may mean you have a more serious problem that needs to be evaluated.\\n\\nLightheadedness has many causes, including:\\n\\nAllergies. Illnesses such as the flu or colds. Home treatment of your flu and cold symptoms usually will relieve lightheadedness. Vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, and other illnesses that cause dehydration. Very deep or rapid breathing (hyperventilation). Anxiety and stress. The use of tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs. A more serious cause of lightheadedness is bleeding. Most of the time, the location of the bleeding and the need to seek medical care are obvious. But sometimes bleeding is not obvious (occult bleeding). You may have small amounts of bleeding in your digestive tract over days or weeks without noticing the bleeding. When this happens, lightheadedness and fatigue may be the first noticeable symptoms that you are losing blood. Heavy menstrual bleeding also can cause this type of lightheadedness.\\n\\nSometimes the cause of lightheadedness is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), which can cause fainting spells (syncope). Unexplained fainting spells need to be evaluated by a doctor. You can check your heart rate by taking your pulse.\\n\\nMany prescription and nonprescription medicines can cause lightheadedness or vertigo. The degree of lightheadedness or vertigo that a medicine causes will vary.\\n\\nVertigo Vertigo occurs when there is conflict between the signals sent to the brain by various balance- and position-sensing systems of the body. Your brain uses input from four sensory systems to maintain your sense of balance and orientation to your surroundings.', \"Vision gives you information about your position and motion in relationship to the rest of the world. This is an important part of the balance mechanism and often overrides information from the other balance-sensing systems. Sensory nerves in your joints allow your brain to keep track of the position of your legs, arms, and torso. Your body is then automatically able to make tiny changes in posture that help you maintain your balance (proprioception). Skin pressure sensation gives you information about your body's position and motion in relationship to gravity. A portion of the inner ear, called the labyrinth, which includes the semicircular canals, contains specialized cells that detect motion and changes in position. Injury to or diseases of the inner ear can send false signals to the brain indicating that the balance mechanism of the inner ear (labyrinth) detects motion. If these false signals conflict with signals from the other balance and positioning centers of the body, vertigo may occur. Common causes of vertigo include:\\n\\nInner ear disorders, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière's disease, vestibular neuritis, or labyrinthitis. Injury to the ear or head. Migraine headaches, which are painful, debilitating headaches that often occur with vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, noise, and smell. Decreased blood flow through the arteries that supply blood to the base of the brain (vertebrobasilar insufficiency). Less common causes of vertigo include:\\n\\nA noncancerous growth in the space behind the eardrum (cholesteatoma). Brain tumors and cancer that has traveled from another part of the body (metastatic). Immediate medical attention is needed if vertigo occurs suddenly with a change in speech or vision or other loss of function. Vertigo that occurs with loss of function in one area of the body can mean a problem in the brain, such as a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).\\n\\nAlcohol and many prescription and nonprescription medicines can cause lightheadedness or vertigo. These problems may develop from:\\n\\nTaking too much of a medicine (overmedicating). Alcohol and medicine interactions. This is a problem, especially for older adults, who may take many medicines at the same time. Misusing a medicine or alcohol use disorder. Drug intoxication or the effects of withdrawal.\", \"Diabetic Neuropathy Charcot Foot Topic Overview What is diabetic neuropathy? Neuropathy means nerve disease or damage. Diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage caused by diabetes. People who have diabetes often have high blood sugar levels. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage nerves throughout your body.\\n\\nThere are three kinds of diabetic neuropathy.\\n\\nPeripheral neuropathy is damage to peripheral nerves. These are the nerves that sense pain, touch, hot, and cold. They also affect movement and muscle strength. The nerves in the feet and lower legs are most often affected. This type of nerve damage can lead to serious foot problems. The damage usually gets worse slowly, over months or years. Autonomic neuropathy is damage to autonomic nerves. These nerves control things like your heartbeat, blood pressure, sweating, digestion, urination, and sexual function. Focal neuropathy affects just one nerve, usually in the wrist, thigh, or foot. It may also affect the nerves of your back and chest and those that control your eye muscles. This type of nerve damage usually happens suddenly. What causes diabetic neuropathy? Over time, high blood sugar levels from diabetes can damage nerves throughout your body. The higher your blood sugar levels, the more likely you are to have nerve damage. So controlling your blood sugar throughout your life is very important.\\n\\nThe older you get, and the longer you have diabetes, the more likely you are to have nerve damage. People who have diabetes who drink too much alcohol are also more likely to have nerve damage.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? Your symptoms will depend on which nerves are injured. You may not be able to feel pain, especially in your feet. This can lead to serious infections, because sores or other problems may not get treated.\\n\\nWhen other parts of your body are affected, symptoms may include:\\n\\nProblems with digestion, such as bloating, belching, constipation, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and belly pain. Problems with body temperature, such as heavy sweating at night or when you eat certain foods. Some people may have reduced sweating, especially in their feet and legs. Problems with urination, such as finding it hard to tell when your bladder is full or finding it hard to empty your bladder completely. Sexual problems, such as erection problems in men and vaginal dryness in women. Heart and blood vessel problems, leading to poor circulation or low blood pressure. This may cause dizziness, weakness, or fainting when you stand or sit up from a reclining position. Trouble sensing when your blood sugar is low. How is diabetic neuropathy diagnosed? Your doctor will check how well you feel light touch and temperature and will test your strength and your reflexes. Tests such as electromyogram and nerve conduction studies may be done to confirm the diagnosis. You may need other tests to see which type of neuropathy you have and to help guide your treatment.\\n\\nDoctors can't test for all types of nerve damage. So it's important to tell your doctor about any pain or weakness you feel. Also mention heavy sweating or dizziness and any changes in digestion, urination, and sexual function.\\n\\nHow is it treated? Treatment involves keeping blood sugar levels in your target range. This will not cure the nerve damage, but it can help keep the damage from getting worse, and the pain might get better.\\n\\nOther treatment depends on your symptoms:\\n\\nPain may be treated with medicines. Digestive system problems or blood vessel problems may be treated with medicines. Blood pressure problems may be treated with medicines and by wearing support stockings (also called compression stockings). Sexual problems may be helped with medicines or devices to improve erections or with lubricating creams that help vaginal dryness. A splint or brace may be used for a pinched nerve. When you have diabetes, you could have a sore or other foot problem without noticing it. Check your feet every day. An untreated problem on your foot can lead to a serious infection or even amputation.\", 'Be clear with your doctor about what is helping you feel better and what is not. You and your doctor can work together to find the treatment that helps you the most.\\n\\nCan diabetic neuropathy be prevented? Keeping your blood sugar levels in your target range, set with your doctor, may help prevent neuropathy from ever developing. The best way to do this is by checking your blood sugar and adjusting your treatment. It is also important to get to and stay at a healthy weight by exercising and eating healthy foods.', 'Depression in Children and Teens Topic Overview Is this topic for you?\\n\\nThis topic covers depression in children and teens. For information about depression in adults, see the topic Depression. For information about depression with episodes of high energy (mania), see the topic Bipolar Disorder in Children and Teens.\\n\\nWhat is depression in children and teens? Depression is a serious mood disorder that can take the joy from a child\\'s life. It is normal for a child to be moody or sad from time to time. You can expect these feelings after the death of a pet or a move to a new city. But if these feelings last for weeks or months, they may be a sign of depression.\\n\\nExperts used to think that only adults could get depression. Now we know that even a young child can have depression that needs treatment to improve. As many as 2 out of 100 young children and 8 out of 100 teens have serious depression.footnote1\\n\\nStill, many children don\\'t get the treatment they need. This is partly because it can be hard to tell the difference between depression and normal moodiness. Also, depression may not look the same in a child as in an adult.\\n\\nIf you are worried about your child, learn more about the symptoms in children. Talk to your child to see how he or she is feeling. If you think your child is depressed, talk to your doctor or a counselor. The sooner a child gets treatment, the sooner he or she will start to feel better.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? A child may be depressed if he or she:\\n\\nIs irritable, sad, withdrawn, or bored most of the time. Does not take pleasure in things he or she used to enjoy. A child who is depressed may also:\\n\\nLose or gain weight. Sleep too much or too little. Feel hopeless, worthless, or guilty. Have trouble concentrating, thinking, or making decisions. Think about death or suicide a lot. The symptoms of depression are often overlooked at first. It can be hard to see that symptoms are all part of the same problem.\\n\\nAlso, the symptoms may be different depending on how old the child is.\\n\\nBoth very young children and grade-school children may lack energy and become withdrawn. They may show little emotion, seem to feel hopeless, and have trouble sleeping. Often they will lose interest in friends and activities they liked before. They may complain of headaches or stomachaches. A child may be more anxious or clingy with caregivers. Teens may sleep a lot or move or speak more slowly than usual. Some teens and children with severe depression may see or hear things that aren\\'t there (hallucinate) or have false beliefs (delusions). Depression can range from mild to severe. A child who feels a little \"down\" most of the time for a year or more may have a milder, ongoing form of depression called dysthymia (say \"dis-THY-mee-uh\"). In its most severe form, depression can cause a child to lose hope and want to die.\\n\\nWhether depression is mild or severe, there are treatments that can help.\\n\\nWhat causes depression? Just what causes depression is not well understood. But it is linked to a problem with activity levels in certain parts of the brain as well as an imbalance of brain chemicals that affect mood. Things that may cause these problems include:\\n\\nStressful events, such as changing schools, going through a divorce, or losing a close family member or friend. Some medicines, such as steroids or opioids for pain relief. Family history. In some children, depression seems to be inherited. How is depression diagnosed? To diagnose depression, a doctor may do a physical exam and ask questions about your child\\'s past health. You and your child may be asked to fill out a form about your child\\'s symptoms. The doctor may ask your child questions to learn more about how he or she thinks, acts, and feels.\\n\\nSome diseases can cause symptoms that look like depression. So the child may have tests to help rule out physical problems, such as a low thyroid level or anemia.', \"Some diseases can cause symptoms that look like depression. So the child may have tests to help rule out physical problems, such as a low thyroid level or anemia.\\n\\nIt is common for children with depression to have other problems too, such as anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or an eating disorder. The doctor may ask questions about these problems to help your child get the right diagnosis and treatment.\\n\\nHow is it treated? Usually one of the first steps in treating depression is education for the child and his or her family. Teaching both the child and the family about depression can be a big help. It makes them less likely to blame themselves for the problem. Sometimes it can help other family members see that they are also depressed.\\n\\nCounseling may help the child feel better. The type of counseling will depend on the age of the child. For young children, play therapy may be best. Older children and teens may benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy. This type of counseling can help them change negative thoughts that make them feel bad.\\n\\nMedicine may be an option if the child is very depressed. Combining antidepressant medicine with counseling often works best. A child with severe depression may need to be treated in the hospital.\\n\\nThere are some things you can do at home to help your child start to feel better.\\n\\nEncourage your child to get regular exercise, spend time with supportive friends, eat healthy foods, and get enough sleep. See that your child takes any medicine as prescribed and goes to all follow-up appointments. Make time to talk and listen to your child. Ask how he or she is feeling. Express your love and support. Remind your child that things will get better in time. What should you know about antidepressant medicines? Antidepressant medicines often work well for children who are depressed. But there are some important things you should know about these medicines.\\n\\nChildren who take antidepressants should be watched closely. These medicines may increase the risk that a child will think about or try suicide, especially in the first few weeks of use. If your child takes an antidepressant, learn the warning signs of suicide, and get help right away if you see any of them. Common warning signs include: Talking, drawing, or writing about death. Giving away belongings. Withdrawing from family and friends. Having a plan, such as a gun or pills. Your child may start to feel better after 1 to 3 weeks of taking antidepressant medicine. But it can take as many as 6 to 8 weeks to see more improvement. Make sure your child takes antidepressants as prescribed and keeps taking them so they have time to work. A child may need to try several different antidepressants to find one that works. If you notice any warning signs or have concerns about the medicine, or if you do not notice any improvement by 3 weeks, talk to your child's doctor. Do not let a child suddenly stop taking antidepressants. This could be dangerous. Your doctor can help you taper off the dose slowly to prevent problems.\", 'Depression\\n\\nWhat is depression? Depression is an illness that causes you to feel sad, lose interest in activities that you\\'ve always enjoyed, withdraw from others, and have little energy. It\\'s different from normal feelings of sadness, grief, or low energy. Depression can also cause people to feel hopeless about the future and even think about suicide.\\n\\nMany people, and sometimes their families, feel embarrassed or ashamed about having depression. Don\\'t let these feelings stand in the way of getting treatment. Remember that depression is a common illness. It affects the young and old, men and women, all ethnic groups, and all professions.\\n\\nIf you think you may be depressed, tell your doctor. Treatment can help you enjoy life again. The sooner you get treatment, the sooner you will feel better.\\n\\nWhat causes depression? Depression is a disease. It\\'s not caused by personal weakness and is not a character flaw. When you have depression, there may be problems with activity levels in certain parts of your brain, or chemicals in your brain called neurotransmitters may be out of balance.\\n\\nMost experts believe that a combination of family history (your genes) and stressful life events may cause depression. Life events can include a death in the family or having a long-term health problem.\\n\\nJust because you have a family member with depression or have stressful life events doesn\\'t mean you\\'ll get depression.\\n\\nYou also may get depressed even if there is no reason you can think of.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? The symptoms of depression may be hard to notice at first. They vary among people, and you may confuse them with just feeling \"off\" or with another health problem.\\n\\nThe two most common symptoms of depression are:\\n\\nFeeling sad or hopeless nearly every day for at least 2 weeks. Losing interest in or not getting pleasure from most daily activities that you used to enjoy, and feeling this way nearly every day for at least 2 weeks. A serious symptom of depression is thinking about death or suicide. If you or someone you care about talks about this or about feeling hopeless, get help right away.\\n\\nIf you think you may have depression, take a short quiz to check your symptoms:\\n\\nInteractive Tool: Are You Depressed? How is it treated? Depression can be treated in various ways. Counseling, psychotherapy, and antidepressant medicines can all be used. Lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise, also may help.\\n\\nWork with your health care team to find the best treatment for you. It may take a few tries, and it can take several weeks for the medicine and therapy to start working. Try to be patient and keep following your treatment plan.\\n\\nDepression can return (relapse). How likely you are to get depression again increases each time you have a bout of depression. Taking your medicines and continuing some types of therapy after you feel better can help keep that from happening. Some people need to take medicine for the rest of their lives. This doesn\\'t stop them from living full and happy lives.\\n\\nWhat can you do if a loved one has depression? If someone you care for is depressed, the best thing you can do is help the person get or stay in treatment. Learn about the disease. Talk to the person, and gently encourage him or her to do things and see people. Don\\'t get upset with the person. The behavior you see is the disease, not the person.', \"Stress Management: Doing Progressive Muscle Relaxation Introduction Have you ever had an aching back or pain in your neck when you were anxious or stressed? When you have anxiety or stress in your life, one of the ways your body responds is with muscle tension. Progressive muscle relaxation is a method that helps relieve that tension.\\n\\nIn progressive muscle relaxation, you tense a group of muscles as you breathe in, and you relax them as you breathe out. You work on your muscle groups in a certain order. When your body is physically relaxed, you cannot feel anxious. Practicing progressive muscle relaxation for a few weeks will help you get better at this skill, and in time you will be able to use this method to relieve stress. When you first start, it may help to use an audio recording until you learn all the muscle groups in order. Check your local library or a bookstore for progressive muscle relaxation audio recordings. If you have trouble falling asleep, this method may also help with your sleep problems.\\n\\nHow do you do progressive muscle relaxation? The procedure You can use an audio recording to help you focus on each muscle group, or you can learn the order of muscle groups and do the exercises from memory. Choose a place where you won't be interrupted and where you can lie down on your back and stretch out comfortably, such as a carpeted floor.\\n\\nBreathe in, and tense the first muscle group (hard but not to the point of pain or cramping) for 4 to 10 seconds. Breathe out, and suddenly and completely relax the muscle group (do not relax it gradually). Relax for 10 to 20 seconds before you work on the next muscle group. Notice the difference between how the muscles feel when they are tense and how they feel when they are relaxed. When you are finished with all of the muscle groups, count backward from 5 to 1 to bring your focus back to the present. After you have learned how to tense and relax each muscle group, here's something else to try. When you have a very tense muscle, you can practice tensing and relaxing that muscle area without going through the whole routine.\\n\\nThe muscle groups The following is a list of the muscle groups in order and how to tense them. Remember to lie down when you do this.\\n\\nMuscle group\\n\\nWhat to do\\n\\nHands\\n\\nClench them.\\n\\nWrists and forearms\\n\\nExtend them, and bend your hands back at the wrist.\\n\\nBiceps and upper arms\\n\\nClench your hands into fists, bend your arms at the elbows, and flex your biceps.\\n\\nShoulders\\n\\nShrug them (raise toward your ears).\\n\\nForehead\\n\\nWrinkle it into a deep frown.\\n\\nAround the eyes and bridge of the nose\\n\\nClose your eyes as tightly as you can.

Diabetes can damage the nerve endings and blood vessels in your feet, making you less likely to notice when your feet are injured. Diabetes can also interfere with your body's ability to fight infection. If you develop a minor foot injury, it could become an ulcer or develop into a serious infection. Ulcers can be found on the bottom of your feet, or on the top or bottom of your toes. With good foot care, you can prevent most of these problems.\\n\\nCaring for your feet is easy. Most of the care can be done when you are bathing and getting ready for bed. Preventing injury to your feet is merely a matter of wearing properly fitted shoes and socks at all times.\\n\\nThese steps can help keep your feet healthy:\\n\\nExamine your feet every day. And have your doctor examine your feet during every visit. Check your shoes for any loose objects or rough edges before you put them on. Look at foot care as part of your daily routine. Soon it will become as automatic as brushing your teeth. Don't use home remedies to treat foot problems. Home remedies can hurt your feet. Over-the-counter medicine designed to remove calluses could contain chemicals that could burn your skin. Also, trying to cut corns or calluses yourself could lead to infections. Get early treatment for any foot problem, even a minor one.\\n\\nHow do you care for your feet? Here's how you can get started caring properly for your feet.\\n\\nInspect your feet at least once a day. Look at all areas of your feet, including your toes. This is the most important part of your foot care. You can use a handheld mirror or magnifying mirror attached to the bathroom wall near the baseboard to inspect your feet. If you can't see well, have someone assist you. Wash your feet daily. Post the steps for foot-washing and nail care in your bathroom. Refer to the steps when you wash your feet so that they become a habit. Make sure you dry your feet and toes well before putting on shoes and socks. Wear shoes and socks that fit well. Soft shoes that have good support and that fit well (such as tennis shoes) are best for your feet. Use the checklist for shoes that fit well when you buy new shoes. Break in new shoes slowly by wearing them for a few hours each day and increasing the number of hours you wear them each week. Wear socks that do not have seams. Protect your feet from injury. Before you put on your shoes, check for objects (such as pebbles) or rough spots inside your shoes or objects pushing through the soles. Inspect your feet for blisters, cuts, or scrapes after activities such as hiking or skiing. If you can't see well, have someone do this for you. Post a list of precautions to protect your feet when you have diabetes in your closet near your shoes. Ask your doctor to check your feet during each visit. Your doctor may notice a foot problem you have missed.\\n\\nTake off your shoes and socks while you are waiting for your doctor. This will help remind your doctor to check your feet. Write down any minor problems or questions you may have about foot care, and take this with you when you visit your doctor. Get early treatment for foot problems. Call your doctor even for minor foot problems, unless you have already learned from your doctor how to handle these problems. Your doctor may refer you to a podiatrist or orthopedic surgeon if special treatment is needed. A serious problem can develop from what seems like a minor irritation. If a foot problem develops, you need to seek care early.\", \"Allergies: Should I Take Shots for Insect Sting Allergies? You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them.\\n\\nAllergies: Should I Take Shots for Insect Sting Allergies?\\n\\nGet the facts Your options Get allergy shots to make you less sensitive to insect stings and reduce the risk of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Do not get allergy shots. Instead try other things such as avoiding stinging insects and carrying epinephrine to deal with the risk of a severe allergic reaction. Key points to remember If you have been stung in the past and had an allergic reaction to the sting, you have a high risk of having a similar reaction if you are stung again. Allergy shots usually are recommended only for people who have already had an anaphylactic (life threatening) reaction to an insect sting. If you had an anaphylactic reaction in the past, allergy shots greatly reduce your risk of having another.footnote1 Whether you need allergy shots depends on your reaction to an insect sting in the past. You may not need allergy shots if you had a normal (localized) reaction, a larger local reaction, or one that caused swelling and redness to much of your body but did not cause anaphylaxis. If you have had allergy tests that found one or more sensitivities to insect stings, allergy shots can prevent life-threatening reactions and also make you less worried about insect stings. Allergy shots may not be safe for you if you have an autoimmune disease or take certain kinds of medicines (such as beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors). Allergy shots can hurt a little, may trigger anaphylaxis in some people, can be costly, and usually take 3 to 5 years to complete.\", \"Tips for Reducing Indoor Pollutants in Your Home\\n\\nTopic Overview\\n\\nExposure to indoor air pollutants can cause respiratory problems, such as asthma attacks, or diseases, such as lung cancer. Pollutants include smoke, pet dander, radon, mold, cleaning products, and other chemicals. You can create a healthier home by following the tips below.footnote1\\n\\nReduce allergens\\n\\nGroom pets often to reduce dander. Don't allow them to sleep in the bedroom with anyone who has asthma or allergies. If possible, keep them off carpets and furniture.\\n\\nChoose window coverings that are easy to clean, such as wood shades or blinds. Drapes are magnets for dust.\\n\\nCheck houseplants for mold. Repot or move them outside if the soil contains mold.\\n\\nDo not allow anyone to smoke in your home.\\n\\nEliminate carpeting and replace it with wood or tile flooring, if possible.\\n\\nIf the humidity level is more than 50% inside your house, dust mites and molds can be a problem. To control dust mites, get allergen-resistant covers for bedding. Wash sheets and blankets in hot water.\\n\\nUse high-efficiency bags in your vacuum cleaner or install a central vacuum system in your home.\\n\\nDon't store firewood indoors. Drying green firewood can contain mold spores.\\n\\nKeep trees and shrubs at least 3 ft (0.9 m) away from your house. Roots can provide an easy path for water into your basement or crawl space.\\n\\nKeep bathrooms, kitchen, and basement—places where allergens are likely to grow—clean and dry.\\n\\nControl moisture\\n\\nFix leaks and other sources of water intrusion, and remove water-damaged materials.\\n\\nMake sure your clothes dryer vents to the outside.\\n\\nInstall and keep clean hood exhaust fans in your kitchen. Make sure bathroom vents exhaust air outdoors and not into basements, crawl spaces, or inside the house.\\n\\nMake sure that exhaust fans don't draw too much air out, creating a negative-pressure situation in which the pressure inside the house is lower than outside. Negative pressure can reverse the flow of combustion gases from furnaces, gas stoves, and water heaters, and draw water vapor and dangerous carbon monoxide or nitrogen dioxide into your home.\\n\\nCaulk the interior and exterior of your home, especially around windows and vents.\\n\\nIf you're building a new home, install a waterproofing system that keeps moisture away from your foundation.\\n\\nKeep gutters and drains clean.\\n\\nRemove any water-damaged carpet. Replace it, if possible, with wood or tile flooring.\\n\\nAvoid heating problems\\n\\nMake sure fuel-burning furnaces, hot water heaters, and gas ranges are checked every year to ensure air intake and exhaust systems are adequate. It is best to have your water heater and furnace outside of your home—for example, in your garage.\\n\\nDo not use kerosene space heaters or unvented gas heaters as your primary source of heat.\\n\\nInstall a carbon monoxide detector in your home. Carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless. You may not notice it until you have health problems. If you see orange or sputtering flames in your gas furnace or stove, it may mean that you have a problem with carbon monoxide. Call a technician immediately.\\n\\nMake sure wood stoves and fireplaces have tight-fitting doors. Check flues and chimneys for cracks that could allow fumes into your house.\\n\\nCheck household furnishings\\n\\nMany furnishings contain formaldehyde and other organic compounds. When shopping for new furniture or cabinets, try to buy those that are made of solid hardwood, not particleboard, which usually has a wood-veneer finish. The wood veneer may be attached with glue that contains formaldehyde.\\n\\nIf someone living in your home has asthma, replace carpet with tile or wood flooring. If carpeting is necessary, use a product with a short nap, or use area rugs that can be cleaned regularly.\\n\\nIf you are remodeling, use gypsum board, plaster, or real wood for walls. Plastic or wood-fiber paneling may emit formaldehyde.\", \"If you are remodeling, use gypsum board, plaster, or real wood for walls.

Consider using natural cleaners, such as vinegar, lemon juice, boric acid, or baking soda.\\n\\nChemicals found in many air fresheners, toilet bowl cleaners, mothballs, and other deodorizing products may be harmful to the lungs.footnote2 Use alternatives. For example, baking soda absorbs odors and can be used instead of an air freshener.\\n\\nDon't keep items you're recycling—such as newspapers, rags, cans or bottles—inside your home. They can be sources of toxic vapors.\\n\\nInstall a radon monitor in your home on the lowest level that you regularly use.\\n\\nMake sure sump basins are sealed and vented to the outdoors.\\n\\nImprove air ventilation\\n\\nMake sure your house gets an adequate supply of fresh air.\\n\\nPlace an air filter in your bedroom, and clean it every 3 months.\\n\\nAir conditioning helps keep pollen and other allergens out of your home, but filters must be kept clean.\\n\\nChange furnace and air conditioner filters every 2 to 3 months.\\n\\nUse exhaust fans in kitchens and bathrooms to vent air outdoors.\\n\\nHave older homes checked for asbestos insulation on furnaces and pipes. Make sure you use an inspector familiar with asbestos issues.\\n\\nClean humidifiers and dehumidifiers often.\\n\\nMake sure outdoor fresh-air intake vents for ducted heating and air conditioning systems are located above ground and are upwind from sources of contaminated air, such as idling cars or trucks.\\n\\nHave ducts for forced-air furnaces cleaned, if needed.\\n\\nMake sure ducts are sealed to prevent air leakage and to keep contaminants from coming into your home.\\n\\nCheck that plumbing drains in your home have full water traps and are connected to a venting system. A sewer smell coming from a sink or water appliance is a sign of poor ventilation.\", \"Age-Related Macular Degeneration Eye structures and vision Condition Basics What is age-related macular degeneration (AMD)? Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease that causes blurring of your central vision. The blurring happens because of damage to the macula, a small area at the back of the eye. The macula helps you see the fine detail in things that your eyes are focusing on.\\n\\nMacular degeneration makes it harder to do things that require sharp central vision, like reading, driving, and recognizing faces. It does not affect side vision, so it does not lead to complete blindness.\\n\\nThere are two types of macular degeneration—wet and dry. The dry form is by far the most common type. The wet form is much less common, but it happens more quickly and is more severe.\\n\\nYou may have either type in just one eye, but over time you may get it in the other eye too.\\n\\nWhat causes it? AMD is the result of damage to the light-detecting nerve cells in the part of the eye called the macula. The cause of the damage to the nerve cells is unknown. A person's genes and family history may play a role.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? The main symptom of AMD is dim or fuzzy central vision. Objects may look warped or smaller than they are. You may have a blank spot in your central vision. Symptoms can depend on the type of AMD. Dry AMD happens slowly. Wet AMD happens suddenly and is more severe.\\n\\nHow is it diagnosed? A doctor can usually detect AMD by doing a regular eye exam. The doctor will ask about your symptoms, past eye problems, and other health conditions. You may have some vision tests, including an ophthalmoscopy, visual acuity test, or Amsler grid test. These tests let your doctor check for signs of the disease.\\n\\nHow is macular degeneration treated? There is no cure for AMD. But certain treatments may delay vision loss.\\n\\nYour doctor can refer you to professionals who help people adjust to living with low vision.\\n\\nFor dry AMD, follow your doctor's advice for having regular exams and watching the condition at home, because dry AMD can sometimes develop into wet AMD. Certain vitamin and mineral supplements may help slow vision loss. Check with your doctor before taking any supplements. Some can have harmful side effects.\\n\\nTreatment for wet AMD can sometimes delay further damage to your central vision. But in most cases, wet AMD starts again. The main treatment for wet AMD is a medicine that is injected into your eye. Sometimes other treatments may be recommended.\\n\\nBecause wet AMD often causes rapid and severe loss of central vision, it is important not to delay treatment if your doctor recommends it.\\n\\nHow can you cope with the changes in your vision? To cope with AMD, try magnifying glasses, brighter lighting, and large-print books. Your doctor may refer you to an occupational therapist or rehabilitation specialist for help. Local agencies may offer services. You may have a range of emotions about AMD. If you feel very sad or hopeless, tell your doctor.\", \"Sprained Ankle: Using a Compression Wrap Applying a Compression Wrap for a Sprained Ankle Introduction Ankle sprains are common injuries that can result in lifelong problems. Some people with repeated or severe sprains can develop long-term joint pain and weakness. Treating a sprained ankle can help prevent ongoing ankle problems.\\n\\nIf an ankle sprain does not heal correctly, the joint may become unstable, resulting in a weakened and easily reinjured ankle. Proper initial care of your sprained ankle is critical.\\n\\nA compression wrap helps decrease swelling. If swelling is kept to a minimum, it may help your ankle feel better. Applying a compression wrap is easy and can be done at home. Elastic bandages are inexpensive and available at most drugstores. You can wear a protective brace, such as a splint or a device to keep your ankle from moving (immobilizer), over a compression wrap. This can help prevent further injury to your ankle when you try to bear weight on it.\\n\\nHow to apply a compression wrap To help control swelling, some doctors recommend wrapping your ankle with an elastic bandage, also called an ACE wrap. This product can be purchased at most drugstores. To apply a compression wrap:\\n\\nCut several horseshoe-shaped pieces of cloth felt to form a 0.5 in. (1.3 cm) thick pad. The pad will be placed (open end up) under the anklebone to help keep fluid out of the hollow place under your anklebone. Roll up the elastic bandage if it isn't already. Hold your ankle at about a 90-degree angle. Start where your toes meet the body of your foot. Hold the loose end of the bandage at the side of your foot. Wrap the bandage around the ball of your foot once, keeping it somewhat taut with a light pull. After this first wrap, slowly start circling your way around the arch of the foot. Pull the bandage diagonally from the bottom of the toes across the foot's top and circle it around the ankle. Now bring the bandage diagonally across the top of the foot and under the arch in a figure-eight pattern. When you get to the anklebone, wrap the bandage around the felt piece so it stays in place under the anklebone. Continue around the ankle and foot in a figure eight, moving toward the heel on the bottom and toward the calf at the top of the eight. The wrap should cover the entire foot and end several inches above the ankle. Most compression wraps are self-fastening or come with clip fasteners. If not, use tape to secure the end. The wrap should be snug but should not cut off circulation to the foot. Check your toes. If they become purplish or blue, cool to the touch, or numb or tingly, the wrap is too tight and should be loosened. Also, loosen the wrap at night before bedtime.\", \"Fitness: Increasing Core Stability Breathing with your diaphragm Spine Pulling your belly in Bridging Introduction Increasing your core stability means making the muscles of your trunk stronger to keep your spine and body stable. This helps you stay balanced when you move.\\n\\nCore stability benefits everyone, from older people to top professional athletes.\\n\\nHow can I increase my core strength and stability? Core stability exercises are easy to do. It's more important that you do them well than that you do a lot of them. That's why it's a good idea to have a physical therapist check to be sure you have learned to use the right muscles and breathe normally while you do the exercises.\\n\\nWhen you do any core stability exercise, it's important to make sure:\\n\\nYou are breathing right. When you exercise, you should mostly breathe with your diaphragm, the large muscle that helps move air in and out of your lungs. To learn to breathe with your diaphragm: Lie on your back, or prop yourself up on several pillows. Put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. When you breathe in, push your belly out as far as possible. You should feel the hand on your belly move out, while the hand on your chest does not move. When you breathe out, you should feel the hand on your belly move in. Notice how it feels to breathe this way. When you start to exercise, try to get the same feeling of your chest and belly moving in and out as you breathe, rather than your chest and shoulders moving up toward your neck and back down. You find your neutral spine. Neutral spine is the name for posture that maintains the three normal curves in your spine—one in your neck, one in your upper back, and one in your lower back. Your spine should be in this neutral position when you do core stability exercises. It may seem more relaxing to let yourself slump down. But when you lose the normal curves of a neutral spine, you actually put more stress on your body. To find your neutral spine: Stand in front of a mirror with your hands on your hips. Allow your low back to arch so your stomach juts forward, and your buttocks stick out. Notice how your hands rotate forward. Tighten the muscles around your stomach and buttocks so your low back becomes very flat.\\n\\nNotice how your hands rotate backward. Now go halfway between the forward and back positions. Keeping your pelvis in this neutral position, stand tall with your ears and shoulders lined up over your hips. Practice finding this neutral spine in three positions: standing, sitting, and lying on your back with your knees bent. When you can do that, you can maintain good posture for daily activities and for exercise. Two simple exercises to try Pulling your belly in\\n\\nYou can do this exercise anywhere, in any position. Try it while you work at your desk, drive, or stand waiting for your turn at the drugstore.\\n\\nPull in your belly and imagine pulling your belly button back toward your spine. Remember to keep your neutral spine while you do this—don't let your back bend forward. Hold this for about 6 seconds. Remember to keep breathing normally. Rest for up to 10 seconds. Repeat 8 to 12 times. Floor bridge\\n\\nThe bridging exercise works the muscles around your lower body and hips. Do not continue with this exercise if it causes pain.\", 'The bridging exercise works the muscles around your lower body and hips. Do not continue with this exercise if it causes pain.\\n\\nLie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Your knees should be bent about 90 degrees. Find your neutral spine position. You will hold it during the exercise. Tighten your belly muscles by pulling in your belly button toward your spine. Then push your heels into the floor, squeeze your buttocks, and lift your hips off the floor until your shoulders, hips, and knees are all in a straight line. Hold about 6 seconds. Remember to breathe normally. Lower yourself slowly to the floor and rest for up to 10 seconds. Repeat 8 to 12 times. After you have mastered these simple exercises, your physical therapist can help you find more challenging ways to work on your trunk muscles. For example, you might do some activities while standing up, then do the same activities while sitting on a large ball called a Swiss ball. The ball makes it harder for you to keep your balance as you do the activity.', 'Sickle Cell Disease Sickle Cell Disease Sickled red blood cells Spleen Carrier Test for Autosomal Recessive Conditions Topic Overview What is sickle cell disease? Sickle cell disease changes normal, round red blood cells into cells that can be shaped like crescent moons. The name \"sickle cell\" comes from the crescent shape of the cells. (A sickle is a tool with a crescent-shaped blade.)\\n\\nNormal red blood cells move easily through your blood vessels, taking oxygen to every part of your body. But sickled cells can get stuck and block blood vessels, which stops the oxygen from getting through. That can cause a lot of pain. It can also harm organs, muscles, and bones.\\n\\nSee a picture of sickle cells blocking a blood vessel.\\n\\nHaving sickle cell disease means a lifelong battle against the health problems it can cause, such as pain, infections, anemia, and stroke. But many people are able to have a very good quality of life by learning to manage the disease.\\n\\nWhat causes sickle cell disease? Sickle cell disease is inherited, which means it is passed from parent to child. To get sickle cell disease, a child has to inherit two sickle cell genes—one from each parent.\\n\\nWhen a child inherits the gene from just one parent, that child has sickle cell trait. Having this trait means that you don\\'t have the disease but you are a carrier and could pass the gene on to your children.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? Painful events (sickle cell crises) are the most common symptom of sickle cell disease. They are periods of pain that happen when sickled cells get stuck in blood vessels and block the blood flow. These events usually cause pain in the hands, feet, belly, back, or chest. The pain may last for hours or for days.\\n\\nPeople with sickle cell disease often have anemia, caused by a shortage of red blood cells. Anemia makes you feel weak and tired. People with sickle cell anemia may look pale or washed out. Their skin and the whites of their eyes may have a yellowish look (jaundice).\\n\\nHow is sickle cell disease diagnosed? A simple blood test can show whether a person has sickle cell disease. Most states test for sickle cell disease before infants go home from the hospital.\\n\\nHow is it treated? Self-care and medical treatment can help you manage pain and avoid other health problems.\\n\\nEarly treatment includes daily antibiotics from 2 months to 5 years of age to help prevent infections. Routine childhood and adult immunizations are also important.\\n\\nManaging pain is often a big part of having sickle cell disease. You can prepare for a painful event ahead of time by creating a pain management plan with your doctor. The plan should include what you can do at home to relieve pain for yourself or your child. The plan should also tell you when it is best to call a doctor or go to a hospital.\\n\\nSome people need regular blood transfusions to lower the risk of stroke and treat anemia and other problems. Some people take medicine to prevent complications. In rare cases, a stem cell transplant might be an option.\\n\\nRegular checkups are an important part of life with this disease. People with sickle cell disease need a good working relationship with a doctor who is an expert in treating it.\\n\\nHow do you manage life with sickle cell disease? Tips for you\\n\\nLearn what triggers, or sets off, painful events called sickle cell crises. Triggers often include cold temperatures, wind, dehydration, and too much exercise. Low oxygen caused by cigarette smoke, high altitude, and plane flights is another common trigger. People with sickle cell disease and their families face ongoing stress. A support network can help ease stress and worry. Ask your doctor if there is a support group in your area. Tips for helping your child', \"Make sure that your child takes antibiotics regularly until age 5 to prevent infections. And make sure he or she receives all the usual immunizations on schedule.

Healthy eating starts with learning new ways to eat, such as adding more fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and cutting back on foods that have a lot of fat, salt, and sugar.\\n\\nA change to healthier eating also includes learning about balance, variety, and moderation.\\n\\nAim for balance. Most days, eat from each food group—grains, protein foods, vegetables and fruits, and dairy. Listen to your body. Eat when you're hungry. Stop when you feel satisfied. Look for variety. Be adventurous. Choose different foods in each food group. For example, don't reach for an apple every time you choose a fruit. Eating a variety of foods each day will help you get all the nutrients you need. Practice moderation. Don't have too much or too little of one thing. All foods, if eaten in moderation, can be part of healthy eating. Even sweets can be okay. Why pay attention to what you eat? Healthy eating will help you get the right balance of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. It will help you feel your best and have plenty of energy.

Type 2 diabetes. Some types of cancer. Is healthy eating the same as going on a diet? Healthy eating is not a diet. It means making changes you can live with and enjoy for the rest of your life.\\n\\nDiets are temporary. Because you give up so much when you diet, you may be hungry and think about food all the time. And after you stop dieting, you also may overeat to make up for what you missed.\\n\\nEating a healthy, balanced variety of foods is far more satisfying. And if you match that with more physical activity, you are more likely to get to a healthy weight—and stay there—than if you diet.\\n\\nHow do you make healthy eating a habit? First, think about your reasons for healthier eating. Do you want to improve your health? Do you want to feel better? Are you trying to set an example for your kids?\\n\\nNext, think about some small changes you can make. Pick ones you can keep doing.\\n\\nDon't try to change everything at once. Set an easy goal you can reach, like having a salad and a piece of fruit each day. Make a long-term goal too, such as having one vegetarian dinner a week. Where can you get support? Having support from others can be a huge help. The more support you have, the easier it will be to make changes. Ask family and friends to practice healthy eating with you.

Hypothyroidism means your thyroid is not making enough thyroid hormone. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way your body uses energy.\\n\\nHaving a low level of thyroid hormone affects your whole body. It can make you feel tired and weak. If hypothyroidism is not treated, it can raise your cholesterol levels. During pregnancy, untreated hypothyroidism can harm your baby. But hypothyroidism can be treated with medicine that can help you feel like yourself again.\\n\\nPeople of any age can get hypothyroidism, but older adults are more likely to get it. Women age 60 and older have the highest risk. You are more likely to get the disease if it runs in your family.\\n\\nWhat causes hypothyroidism? In the United States, the most common cause is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It causes the body's immune system to attack thyroid tissue. As a result, the gland can't make enough thyroid hormone.\\n\\nOther things that can lead to low levels of thyroid hormone include surgery to remove the thyroid gland and radiation therapy for cancer. Less common causes include viral infections and some drugs, such as amiodarone and lithium.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? Hypothyroidism can cause many different symptoms, such as:\\n\\nFeeling tired, weak, or depressed. Dry skin and brittle nails. Not being able to stand the cold. Constipation. Memory problems or having trouble thinking clearly. Heavy or irregular menstrual periods. Symptoms occur slowly over time. At first you might not notice them, or you might mistake them for normal aging. See your doctor if you have symptoms like these that get worse or won't go away.\\n\\nHow is hypothyroidism diagnosed? Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms. You will also have a physical exam. If your doctor thinks you have hypothyroidism, a simple blood test can show if your thyroid hormone level is too low.\\n\\nHow is it treated? Doctors usually prescribe pills to treat hypothyroidism. Most people start to feel better in a week or two. Your symptoms will probably go away within a few months. But you will likely need to keep taking the pills from now on.\\n\\nIt's important to take your medicine just the way your doctor tells you to. You will also need to see your doctor for follow-up visits to make sure you have the right dose. Getting too much or too little thyroid hormone can cause problems.\\n\\nIf you have mild hypothyroidism, you may not need treatment now. But you'll want to watch for signs that it is getting worse.\\n\\nIf you are diagnosed with severe hypothyroidism, you will need to be treated right away in the hospital. Severe hypothyroidism can lead to a rare but dangerous disease called myxedema coma.\\n\\nCause In the United States, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This is a condition that causes the body's natural defenses—the immune system—to produce antibodies that over time destroy thyroid tissue. As a result, the thyroid gland cannot make enough thyroid hormone.\\n\\nWorldwide, iodine deficiency is the number one cause of hypothyroidism. But iodine added to salt, food, and water has nearly eliminated this problem in the U.S. and other Western countries.\\n\\nOther common causes of hypothyroidism include:\", 'Other common causes of hypothyroidism include:\\n\\nThyroid surgery. Part or all of the thyroid gland may be removed to treat disorders such as having too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism), an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) that makes swallowing difficult, thyroid cancer, or thyroid nodules that may be overactive or cancerous. Hypothyroidism results when the thyroid gland is removed or when remaining thyroid tissue does not function properly. Radioactive iodine therapy, which is often used to treat hyperthyroidism. Radioactive iodine therapy can destroy the thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism. External beam radiation, which is used to treat some cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma. This radiation treatment can destroy the thyroid gland. Less common causes include:\\n\\nInfections. Viral and bacterial infections can temporarily damage the thyroid gland. This causes a short-term form of the condition. Hypothyroidism caused by infection usually does not result in permanent hypothyroidism. Medicines. Some medicines can interfere with normal production of thyroid hormone. Lithium is one of the most common medicines that causes hypothyroidism. Others include amiodarone and interferon alfa (such as Intron A or Roferon A). In rare cases, disorders of the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus (secondary and tertiary forms of hypothyroidism). The pituitary gland and hypothalamus produce hormones that control the thyroid and, as a result, affect its ability to produce thyroid hormone. Excessive iodine, which, in food or medicines, can reduce the function of the thyroid gland. This is usually temporary. Congenital hypothyroidism. In rare cases, an infant is born without a properly functioning thyroid gland. All children born in a hospital in the U.S. are tested at birth for hypothyroidism.', \"Ear Infection: Should I Give My Child Antibiotics? You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them.\\n\\nEar Infection: Should I Give My Child Antibiotics?\\n\\nGet the facts Your options Wait and see if the ear infection clears up on its own. Give your child antibiotics. Key points to remember This topic is only appropriate for children 6 months and older. Most ear infections clear up on their own. Antibiotics do not help with ear pain immediately. You can treat pain at home with pain relievers and by putting a warm washcloth on your child's ear. If your child is age 6 months or older and has a mild earache, you can wait for up to 48 hours to see if the infection gets better on its own. Talk to your doctor if your child's pain doesn't get better with an over-the-counter pain reliever (such as acetaminophen) or if other symptoms last for more than 48 hours. Doctors usually prescribe antibiotics if a child:footnote1 Is younger than 2 and has an infection in both ears or has more than mild pain or fever. Is very ill from the infection. For example, your child may be dehydrated. Has other health problems, such as cleft palate or repeat infections that could put him or her at risk for serious problems from an ear infection. Has cochlear implants. If your doctor prescribes antibiotics, you may have to wait at least another 48 hours for the medicine to take effect. Antibiotics can have side effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and an allergic reaction. Taking antibiotics when they're not needed can make it hard for these medicines to work the next time your child needs them.\\n\\nThis can happen because bacteria can build up resistance to the medicine. FAQs What is a middle ear infection? A middle ear infection, also called otitis media, is inflammation or infection of the middle ear. Ear infections often occur along with a cold or other upper respiratory infections. Almost all children have at least one ear infection before age 7.\\n\\nMost ear infections are caused by bacteria. But viruses also can cause them. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the influenza (flu) virus are the two main viruses that cause ear infections.\\n\\nEar infections are most common in young children, because young children have shorter eustachian tubes, which are more easily blocked than those of older children and adults. When the tube is blocked, fluid builds up. This creates a breeding ground for germs.\\n\\nPus forms as the body tries to fight the infection. More fluid collects and pushes against the eardrum, causing pain and sometimes a temporary loss of hearing. Fever lasts about 1 to 2 days. Most children have some pain on and off for up to 4 days. Young children may have pain that comes and goes for up to 9 days. How can you tell if your child has an ear infection? If your child has an ear infection, he or she may:\\n\\nHave an earache. It may be mild, or it may hurt a lot. Act fussy (babies or young children) or grumpy. Pull at his or her ears. Have trouble sleeping. Have trouble hearing. Have a fever. Not feel like eating. Vomit. Most parents will know that these symptoms point to an ear infection after their children have had a couple of ear infections. But a visit to the doctor is the only way to know for sure. Your child's doctor can diagnose an infection by looking at your child's ears with a tool called an otoscope. How well do antibiotics clear up ear infections? Antibiotics work most of the time to treat ear infections caused by bacteria. But they won't treat ear infections caused by viruses.\\n\\nNo matter what causes the infection, most children 6 months and older won't need antibiotics. Up to 80 out of 100 ear infections get better on their own, while 20 out of 100 don't. How can you treat your child's ear infection at home? You can help ease your child's pain at home, whether you use antibiotics or wait for the ear infection to get better on its own.\\n\\nYou can:\", \"You can:\\n\\nGive your child an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin). Read and follow all instructions on the label. If you give medicine to your baby, follow your doctor's advice about what amount to give. Do not give aspirin to anyone younger than 20. Aspirin has been linked to Reye syndrome, a serious illness.\\n\\nPut a warm washcloth on the ear. Help your child rest by arranging quiet play. Give your child eardrops for pain if your doctor prescribes them. Why might your doctor recommend antibiotics for an ear infection?\\n\\nDoctors usually prescribe antibiotics if a child:\\n\\nIs younger than 6 months, because infections at this age are less likely to go away during watchful waiting. And normal hearing is very important when a young child is learning to talk. Is very ill from the infection. For example, your child may be dehydrated. Has other health problems, such as cleft palate or repeat infections that could put him or her at risk for serious problems from an ear infection. Has cochlear implants. Children who have these hearing devices are at risk for more serious infection.\", \"Panic Attacks and Panic Disorder Topic Overview What are panic attacks and panic disorder? A panic attack is a sudden, intense fear or anxiety that may make you short of breath or dizzy or make your heart pound. You may feel out of control. Some people believe that they are having a heart attack or are about to die. An attack usually lasts from 5 to 20 minutes. But it may last even longer, up to a few hours. You have the most anxiety about 10 minutes after the attack starts. If these attacks happen often, they are called a panic disorder.\\n\\nPanic attacks can be scary and so bad that they get in the way of your daily activities. Treatment can help most people have fewer symptoms or even stop the attacks.\\n\\nMore women than men get panic attacks.\\n\\nWhat causes panic attacks and panic disorder? Experts aren't sure what causes panic attacks and panic disorder. But the body has a natural response when you are stressed or in danger. It speeds up your heart, makes you breathe faster, and gives you a burst of energy. This is called the fight-or-flight response. It gets you ready to either cope with or run away from danger. A panic attack occurs when this response happens when there is no danger.\\n\\nSome people are more sensitive to anxiety and panic than others. Panic attacks and panic disorder may be more likely if you have a family history of panic disorder. They sometimes happen with no clear cause.\\n\\nPanic attacks may also be brought on by:\\n\\nA health problem such as an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), or heart or breathing problems. Depression or another mood disorder. Heavy alcohol use. Using too much nicotine or too much caffeine. Taking certain medicines, such as those used to treat asthma and heart problems. Drug use. Living with high levels of stress for a long time. You have a higher chance of getting panic disorder if you have a parent with depression or bipolar disorder.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? Symptoms of a panic attack may include:\\n\\nA feeling of intense fear, terror, or anxiety. Trouble breathing or very fast breathing. Chest pain or tightness. A heartbeat that races or isn't regular. Sweating. Nausea or an upset stomach. Dizziness and shaking. Numbness or tingling. Symptoms of panic disorder may include:\\n\\nRepeated panic attacks when there is no reason for the fight-or-flight response. Changing your daily activities because you worry that you will have another attack. Some people have a fear of being in crowds, standing in line, or going into shopping malls. They are afraid of having another panic attack or of not being able to escape. This problem is called agoraphobia. It can be so bad for some people that they never leave their homes.\\n\\nPeople who have panic disorder often have depression at the same time.\\n\\nHow are panic attacks and panic disorder diagnosed? Your doctor will ask about your past health and do a physical exam. The exam may include listening to your heart, checking your blood pressure, and ordering blood tests to look for other causes of your problem.\\n\\nHow are they treated? Treatment for panic attacks and panic disorder includes counseling, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Medicines may also help. Treatment can help most people control or even stop attacks. But symptoms can come back, especially if you stop treatment too soon.\\n\\nEarly treatment of panic attacks is very important. It can prevent other problems related to panic disorder. These problems include depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorder.\", \"Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) Temporomandibular (TM) joint Temporomandibular disorder (TMD): Areas of pain Condition Basics What are temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) is the name given to several problems with jaw movement and pain in and around the jaw joints. They cause pain when you talk, chew, swallow, or yawn.\\n\\nYou may also hear TMDs called TMJ or TM problems.\\n\\nThe jaw joints, or temporomandibular (TM) joints, connect the lower jawbone (mandible) to the skull. These flexible joints are used more than any other joint in the body. They allow the jaw to open and close for talking, chewing, swallowing, yawning, and other movements.\\n\\nWhat causes them? TMDs are caused by muscle tension, often triggered by stress. Clenching or grinding your teeth can tire the jaw muscles, leading to muscle spasms, tissue damage, pain, and sore muscles. A TMD can also start with an injury to the jaw joint or a joint disease like osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? TMDs can affect the jaw and jaw joint as well as muscles in the face, shoulder, head, and neck. Common symptoms include joint pain, muscle pain, headaches, joint sounds, trouble with fully opening the mouth, and jaw locking.\\n\\nHow are they diagnosed? There is no one way to diagnose a TMD. Your doctor can check your condition with a physical exam and by asking questions about your health. In some cases, an X-ray, CT scan, or MRI is also used to check for bone or soft tissue problems related to symptoms of a TMD.\\n\\nHow are TMDs treated? The focus of TMD treatment is to ease pain in the jaw joint and restore normal jaw movement. Initial treatment involves over-the-counter pain medicine and self-care at home. Splints can help reduce teeth grinding and clenching. Your doctor may suggest other treatments as well. Surgery isn't usually done to treat TMDs.\", \"Immunizations: Questions Parents Ask Common Questions What are immunizations? Immunizations help keep you and your child from getting a disease. They contain medicine that causes the body to make antibodies. These antibodies can then recognize and fight the disease if you or your child is later exposed to it.\\n\\nImmunizations are also called vaccines or vaccinations.\\n\\nWhy should my child get immunized? Vaccines:\\n\\nHelp prevent you or your child from getting dangerous diseases for which there are often no medical treatments. Help keep disease from spreading. Help protect people with weak immune systems, who may not be able to get vaccines. Their only protection is for others to get vaccinated so illnesses are less common. Cost less than getting treated for the diseases. Have very few serious side effects. Often are needed before a child can attend school or day care. Prevent days out of work or school due to illness or caring for a sick person. Vaccines are the best way we have to prevent infectious diseases. A successful vaccine program depends on everyone getting vaccinated.\\n\\nWhen should my child be immunized? Ask your doctor what shots your child should get. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) keeps a list of shots needed for each age group.\\n\\nWhy do I have to use the government schedule? Can't I use my own schedule?\\n\\nThe schedule recommended by experts is designed to work best with a child's immune system at certain ages and at certain times. The schedule is set up so that your child gets the best protection possible at the earliest age possible from the fewest shots possible.\\n\\nExperts review the schedules every year based on the best research available and change the schedules as needed.\\n\\nA different schedule may not provide protection for your child. If shots are spread out or skipped, a child may get the disease during the delay.\\n\\nWhy does my child need so many doses to protect against one disease? Your child gets as many shots as needed to give him or her full protection from a disease. This may be one shot only, or it may be several doses.\\n\\nMore than one dose may be needed because immunity may have to build up over time. You want the best combination of immediate and future protection for your child. This means that your child needs a certain amount of vaccine spaced apart at different ages. This builds the best protection.\\n\\nDon't babies get natural protection from the mother? During the last few weeks of pregnancy, mothers give their babies some protection against disease. But it is only for diseases that the mother is protected against. The protection the baby gets does not last long.\\n\\nHaven't we gotten rid of most diseases children are immunized for? Vaccinations in the United States have led to a sharp drop in diseases. Better living conditions have also helped, but they aren't enough to protect you from disease.\\n\\nRemember that a vaccine gives your child protection from the disease. A vaccine does not get rid of the disease. The disease still exists, and if fewer children get immunized for a disease, the disease could come back.\\n\\nAnd some diseases no longer found in the U.S., such as polio, still exist in other countries. People who travel or move to the U.S. can bring these diseases into the country. So it's still very important to have your child immunized.\\n\\nIs it okay to skip a shot when my child is sick? On very rare occasions, your doctor may suggest waiting to have your child immunized. For example, you may need to wait when your child has:\\n\\nA history of serious allergic reaction to a vaccine. Severe vomiting or diarrhea, when dehydration is a concern. A serious illness, such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis, or a severe asthma attack. But children usually can still get a shot even when they have a minor illness. This includes a cold or an ear infection. And children usually can still get a shot when they are taking antibiotics.\\n\\nTalk to your doctor if you have any concerns about having your child immunized.\", \"Pregnancy\\n\\nNormal pregnancy: First trimester Normal pregnancy: Second trimester Normal pregnancy: Third trimester Topic Overview Is this topic for you? This topic covers pregnancy information, including planning for labor and delivery. If you aren't pregnant yet, see the topic Preparing for a Healthy Pregnancy. For more information on labor and delivery, see the topic Labor and Delivery.\\n\\nWhat can you do to have a healthy pregnancy? You may be happy and excited to find out that you're pregnant.

But you don't have to know everything right away. You can read all about pregnancy now, or you can learn about each stage as your pregnancy goes on.\\n\\nPregnancy is measured in trimesters from the first day of your last menstrual period, totaling 40 weeks. Most babies are born at 37 to 42 weeks.\\n\\nDuring your pregnancy, you'll have tests to watch for certain problems that could occur. With all the tests you'll have, you may worry that something will go wrong. But most women have healthy pregnancies. If there is a problem, these tests can find it early so that you and your doctor or midwife can treat it or watch it to help improve your chance of having a healthy baby.\\n\\nTaking great care of yourself is the best thing you can do for yourself and your baby.

These can harm you and the baby.\\n\\nWhat kinds of exams and tests will you have? Your first prenatal exam gives your doctor or midwife important information for planning your care. You'll have a pelvic exam and urine and blood tests. You'll also have your blood pressure and weight checked. The urine and blood tests are used for a pregnancy test and to tell whether you have low iron levels (are anemic) or have signs of infection.\\n\\nAt each prenatal visit you'll be weighed, have your belly measured, and have your blood pressure and urine checked. Go to all your appointments. Although these quick office visits may seem simple and routine, your doctor is watching for signs of possible problems like high blood pressure.\\n\\nIn some medical centers, you can have screening in your first trimester to see if your baby has a chance of having Down syndrome or another genetic problem. The test usually includes a blood test and an ultrasound.\\n\\nDuring your second trimester, you can have a blood test (triple or quadruple screen test) to see if you have a higher-than-normal chance of having a baby with birth defects. Based on the results of the tests, you may be referred to a geneticist for further discussion. Or you may have other tests to find out for sure if your baby has a birth defect.\\n\\nLate in your second trimester, your blood sugar will be checked for diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes). Near the end of your pregnancy, you will have tests to look for infections that could harm your newborn.\\n\\nWhat changes can you expect in your body and your emotions? You will go through some amazing changes during pregnancy. Your body, emotions, and relationships will all do some growing. These changes are common, but some may be a challenge.\\n\\nEvery woman feels these changes in her own way. Even the way she changes can change.

Do not have a PSA blood test to check for prostate cancer. This information is for men in their 50s and 60s. But it also may be helpful to other men who are thinking about this decision.\\n\\nKey points to remember PSA tests can help find some prostate cancers early, when the cancer may be easier to treat. The largest study of prostate cancer screening so far showed that PSA testing may prevent a small number of men from dying of prostate cancer. A high PSA level can have many causes, including an enlarged prostate, an infection, or, less often, prostate cancer. A high PSA can cause a lot of worry and lead to more tests. But most high PSA test results will not turn out to be from cancer. Many cancers found by PSA tests would not have caused a problem if they had not been found through screening. But when they are found, they often get treated with surgery to remove the prostate or with radiation. These cancer treatments may not have been needed. And they can have serious side effects, such as urinary, bowel, and erection problems. Many prostate cancers grow slowly. This means that many men with prostate cancer will die of something else before their prostate cancer advances enough to cause any problems. With faster-growing prostate cancers, finding the cancer early may not help you live longer. Some prostate cancers will be fatal no matter when they are found or how they are treated. FAQs What is prostate cancer? Prostate cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the tissues of the prostate gland. It is the second most common cancer in men. Most men who get it are older than 65.\\n\\nEarly prostate cancer usually doesn't cause symptoms. When prostate cancer is found before it has spread outside the prostate gland, a man's options include active surveillance, surgery to remove the prostate, or radiation. If a prostate cancer grows or spreads, symptoms may develop, including urinary problems (such as blood in the urine) and bone pain.\\n\\nMany prostate cancers grow slowly. This means that many men with prostate cancer will die of something else before their prostate cancer advances enough to cause any problems.

A PSA test may show a high level that is not caused by cancer (called a false-positive). If your PSA test is high, you may need more tests—like a prostate biopsy—to check for cancer. These tests can be harmful. For example, prostate biopsies can cause infections. For a few men, these infections are very serious. These tests can also cause a lot of worry. A PSA test may find cancers that would not have caused a problem (called overdiagnosis). This can lead to cancer treatments that you don't need. These treatments can cause urinary, bowel, and erection problems. You may miss the chance of finding prostate cancer early, when the cancer may be easier to treat.

How can you quit? Quitting smoking is hard. Some people who have quit say that it was the hardest thing they have ever done. But most smokers eventually are able to quit smoking. And you don't have to do it alone. Ask your family, friends, and doctor to help you. Get what you need to help you quit for good.\\n\\nGet ready. If you're ready to quit right now, go ahead. Medicines and support can help you stay on track. But if you want to plan ahead, you don't have to stop right away. Set a date to quit. Pick a time when you won't have a lot of stress in your life. Think about cutting down on smoking before your quit date. You can try to decrease the number of cigarettes you smoke each day as a way to quit smoking. Get rid of ashtrays, lighters, or spit cups before you quit. Talk to your partner or friends about helping you stay smoke-free. Don't let people smoke in your house. Change your routine. For example, if you smoke after eating, take a walk instead. Use medicine. It can help with cravings and stress, and it doubles your chances of quitting smoking.footnote1 You can buy nicotine gum, lozenges, or patches without a prescription. Your doctor may also prescribe medicine, such as bupropion (Zyban) or varenicline (Chantix). If you take varenicline, you can stop smoking a little bit at a time, which may increase your chance of quitting. Get support.

Remind yourself that you have a plan, and think about how hard you've worked to quit for good.\\n\\nWhy is it so hard to quit? Quitting is hard because your body depends on the nicotine in tobacco. Giving it up is more than just kicking a bad habit. Your body has to stop craving the nicotine. Nicotine gum, lozenges, patches, and other medicines can help reduce the cravings without the harmful effects of smoking.\", \"You also have to change your habits. You may not even think about smoking. You just do it. You may not realize it, but seeing someone smoke—or just seeing cigarettes—may cause you to want to smoke. You may smoke when you drink alcohol or when you are stressed. Or maybe you have a cigarette with coffee. Before you quit, think of new ways to handle these things. For example, call a friend or practice deep breathing when you feel stressed. Try chewing sugarless gum instead of smoking. Go for a walk when you have a break at work. When you first start your quit, it's okay to stay around nonsmokers. And it's okay to avoid situations where you may be tempted to smoke (like occasions where alcohol will be served) until you feel more confident about staying smoke-free.\\n\\nWhat if you feel bad when you are trying to quit? You are likely to crave cigarettes and to have withdrawal symptoms. You may feel grouchy or restless or you may have a hard time concentrating for the first 2 to 3 weeks after you quit. It may be hard to focus on tasks. Or you may have trouble sleeping and want to eat more. But you won't feel bad forever, and medicine can help. Using medicines and products like nicotine gum or patches can help with cravings and make it easier to resist smoking.\\n\\nWill you gain weight? You may worry about gaining weight after you stop smoking. This is understandable. In fact, many smokers do gain weight during their quit attempt. In your plan to quit smoking, include eating healthy snacks and doing some physical activity to help you avoid weight gain during your quit.\\n\\nIf you do gain weight, you can focus on losing it after you have successfully quit smoking. Be patient with yourself and try to tackle one change at a time.\\n\\nYou can take steps to lower your chance of gaining weight:\\n\\nTry to be active. Exercise can also improve your mood and reduce your craving for a cigarette. If you haven't been getting much exercise, start walking every day, gradually increasing how far you walk. Or take a beginning yoga class. If you are already active, see about joining others for a sport you enjoy, such as biking, hiking, or playing volleyball. Eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and eat fewer high-fat foods. Cutting back on food (dieting) can make quitting smoking harder. Try not to substitute food for cigarettes. Instead, chew gum, or chew on a drinking straw or a coffee stirrer. Use quit-smoking medicines or nicotine replacement. They may make gaining weight less likely while you are quitting smoking.\\n\\nWhat if you start smoking again? Most people quit and restart many times before they stop smoking for good. If you start smoking again after you quit, don't give up. If you return to smoking, but smoke less than before, try to keep your smoking at that lower level so it will be easier to quit in the future. Also, if you are ready to try to quit again soon, do so. You do not need to wait to try again. Each time you quit, even if it is just for a short time, you get closer to your long-term goal.\\n\\nRemind yourself that by quitting you may avoid serious health problems and live longer. Remember your reasons for quitting. Maybe you want to protect your heart and your health and live longer.\\n\\nEach time you quit, you learn more about what helps and what gets in the way. Think about why you started smoking again and about what you will do differently next time. If you tried to quit without medicines or counseling, think about trying them next time. If you did use a medicine and counseling, think about trying a different type next time, or think about changing other things in your life, like travel routines and recreation. Medicines and nicotine replacement (gum, patches, lozenges) can double your chances of success.footnote1 And using medicines and counseling is even more effective. You can do it!\", \"Healthy Aging Body Fat Distribution Topic Overview What is healthy aging? Getting older is a natural part of life. How you will feel as you get older depends on many things, including what health problems run in your family and the choices you make. If you take good care of your body and learn positive ways to deal with stress now, you can slow down or even prevent problems that often come with getting older.\\n\\nIt's never too early or too late to change bad habits and start good ones. No matter when you start, a healthy lifestyle can make a difference in how you feel and what you can do.\\n\\nWhat determines how healthy you will be as you get older? The changes you'll go through as you get older depend on a number of things. One is your family history (genetics). If your family members have diseases or ongoing (chronic) health problems like high blood pressure or diabetes, then you may have a greater chance of having those problems yourself. But just because your risk is higher, it doesn't mean you will definitely have the same problems. In fact, the lifestyle choices you make can help reduce your chances of getting illnesses that run in your family. And even if you do get a family illness, choosing to be physically active, to eat healthy foods, and to learn how to deal with stress can keep the illness from destroying your ability to enjoy your golden years.\\n\\nWhat kinds of changes should you expect as you age? Changes as you get older are usually gradual. Certain physical changes are common. Your metabolism (how fast your body can burn calories) slows over time, which means that your body needs less food energy than before. How much and how well you sleep will likely change. Most people start needing reading glasses around age 40, and many have some hearing loss later in life. Starting in your 50s, bone aging increases. Also starting around age 50, you may notice changes in sexual function—it's normal to have a slower sexual response.\\n\\nMost vital organs gradually become less efficient with age. The kidneys are less able to keep enough water in your body. And the heart can start to show signs of wear and tear. So as you get older, it's important to be physically active, drink plenty of water, and choose healthy foods. Doing these things will help your body work well for a longer period of time.\\n\\nWhat do you need to do to feel your best as you age? One of the most important things you can do for your health at any age is to be physically active. Physical activity keeps your body strong, and it helps with how you feel. People who stay active are less likely to get depressed. Physical activity can be anything from walking to gardening to working out at the gym. The important thing is to be active almost every day. No matter what your age or condition, there is a type of physical activity that's right for you. Always ask your doctor whether it is safe for you to start a physical activity program.\\n\\nYour mental and emotional health are also important. Protect or improve your emotional health by staying in touch with friends, family, and the community. People who feel connected to others are more likely to thrive than those who do not. And try to keep stress at a minimum. In addition to getting regular physical activity, you can take charge of how stress affects you by taking 20 minutes a day to just relax.\\n\\nTo protect or improve your memory and mental sharpness, keep your brain active and challenged. Learn or do something new and different. For example, attend an educational workshop or learn a new card game. Depression can be a serious problem for older adults. If you think you may be depressed, seek help—antidepressant medicine and counseling can help treat depression.\\n\\nOther good health habits can help you stay at your best:\\n\\nEat a healthy, balanced diet. Avoid salty foods and foods with a lot of fat in them, such as fried foods. Remember that sexually transmitted infections can affect anyone at any age, so practicing safer sex is a must. If you smoke, try to quit. Always wear your seat belt. Don't abuse alcohol or drugs.\", \"714-X (PDQ®): Integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies - Patient Information [NCI] This information is produced and provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The information in this topic may have changed since it was written. For the most current information, contact the National Cancer Institute via the Internet web site at http://cancer.gov or call 1-800-4-CANCER.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nQuestions and Answers About 714-X What is 714-X? The main ingredient in 714-X is made by combining chemicals with camphor, a natural substance that comes from the wood and bark of the camphor tree. Ammonia and salt are added to camphor to make 714-X.\\n\\nWhat is the history of the discovery and use of 714-X as a complementary and alternative treatment for cancer? 714-X was developed in the 1960s in Canada, where it is still being made. Patients in Canada can get 714-X only from a doctor, for compassionate use (giving a treatment to patients before it is approved, because they have a life-threatening disease and there is no drug or other therapy to treat the disease). 714-X is used in Mexico and some western European countries. It is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States (see Question 8).\\n\\nWhat is the theory behind the claim that 714-X is useful in treating cancer? The development of 714-X was based on the theory that there are tiny living things in the blood called somatids. According to this theory, some types of somatids are found only in the blood of people who have cancer or other serious diseases. These types of somatids are said to make growth hormones that cause cells to grow without control. The makers of 714-X state that by looking at the number and type of somatids in the blood, doctors can see if cancer is starting to form or can diagnose cancer and predict where the cancer will spread.\\n\\nThe theory states that cancer cells trap nitrogen needed by normal cells and make a toxic substance that weakens the immune system. 714-X is reported to help the body fight cancer cells in these ways:\\n\\nThe camphor in 714-X is said to prevent cancer cells from taking nitrogen from the body's normal cells. 714-X is also said to help the immune system by increasing the flow of lymph, the colorless fluid that travels through the body carrying white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Some research studies are published in scientific journals. Most scientific journals have experts who review research reports before they are published, to make sure that the evidence and conclusions are sound. This is called peer review. Studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals are considered to be better evidence. No studies have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals to support the theory of somatids in the development of cancer. Research on the use of 714-X as a cancer treatment is discussed in Question 5 and Question 6.\\n\\nHow is 714-X administered? 714-X is usually given by injection near the lymph nodes in the groin. In some patients with lung or oral cancer, 714-X can be sprayed into the nose using a nebulizer (a device that turns liquid into a fine spray). The makers of 714-X do not recommend injecting it into a vein (intravenously) or taking it by mouth.\\n\\nThe makers of 714\\n\\nX suggest the following:\\n\\n714-X is more effective if given early in the disease, before chemotherapy or radiation therapy is begun. 714-X can be used along with conventional treatments. Vitamin B 12 supplements, vitamin E supplements, shark cartilage, and alcohol should not be used during treatment with 714-X. Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using 714-X? Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a drug, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. Animal tumor models are used to learn how a cancer may progress and to test new treatments. These preclinical studies are done before any testing in humans is begun.\", 'No laboratory studies of the safety and/or effectiveness of 714-X have been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. A few animal experiments have been done, but the results of these experiments have not been reported in scientific journals. The animal studies used a lymphosarcoma tumor model in rats and lymphoma tumor models in dogs and cows. 714-X was not found to be effective against cancer in these studies.\\n\\nHave any clinical trials (research studies with people) of 714-X been conducted? No clinical trials or other studies with cancer patients have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals to support the safety or effectiveness of 714-X. A number of anecdotal reports (incomplete descriptions of the medical and treatment history of one or more patients) and testimonials (personal reports from people who claim to have been helped or cured by the product) have been published in newspapers and other nonmedical literature. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) reviewed the records of some cancer patients who used 714-X. This review was done to decide if NCI should begin a clinical trial of the product. Not enough information was available to support recommending a trial.\\n\\nHave any side effects or risks been reported from 714-X? The makers of 714-X claim that it is not harmful to humans. The reported side effects of treatment with 714-X are redness, tenderness, and swelling at the injection site.\\n\\nIs 714-X approved by the FDA as a cancer treatment in the United States? The FDA has not approved 714-X for use in the United States.', 'Cancer Pain (PDQ®): Supportive care - Health Professional Information [NCI] This information is produced and provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

The goal of the following summary is to provide evidence-based, up-to-date, and practical information on the management of cancer pain.\\n\\nEffective pain management can generally be accomplished by paying attention to the following steps:[1]\\n\\nRegular screening to ensure that the patient\\'s pain is recognized early. (Refer to the Pain Assessment section of this summary for more information.) Proper characterization of the pain to identify underlying pathophysiology, which could significantly influence treatment options. (Refer to the Pain Classification section of this summary for more information). Is the pain acute or chronic? Is it secondary to cancer, cancer treatment, other causes, or a combination? Is it somatic, visceral, neuropathic, or mixed? Is there an incidental component? Is there breakthrough pain? Determining whether the pain requires pharmacologic and/or other modalities of treatment. Pain is often multifactorial in nature, so factors that may modulate pain expression, such as psychological distress and substance use, should be assessed. (Refer to the Background and Definitions section of this summary for more information.) What is the impact of pain on the patient? Is the benefit of treatment likely going to outweigh the risks? Identifying the optimal pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options (refer to the Pharmacologic Therapies for Pain Control section of this summary for more information), including referrals to specialists, if needed. (Refer to the Modalities for Pain Control: Other Approaches section of this summary for more information.) Complex pain often requires multidimensional interdisciplinary evaluation and intervention.\\n\\nThere are many issues to consider when determining the most appropriate treatment, such as the following: Previous pain treatments. Patient prognosis. Predictive factors for pain control (e.g., psychological distress). Impact on function. Comorbidities (e.g., renal or hepatic failure). Risk of misuse of or addiction to pain medications. Patient preference. Providing proper education about treatment, including medication administration, expected side effects and associated treatments, and when patients can expect improvement. If opioids are considered, fear of opioids and the risks of opioid use and misuse should be addressed. Patients and family caregivers should be educated about the safe storage, use, and disposal of opioids. One study demonstrated that improper use, storage, and disposal are common among cancer outpatients. [2] Monitoring the patient longitudinally with return visits to titrate/adjust treatments. Patients with cancer or noncancer pain requiring chronic therapy are monitored closely to optimize treatment and to minimize the likelihood of complications of opioid use, including misuse or abuse. The risks and benefits of opioid use are evaluated regularly, and physician impressions are discussed openly with the patient. Background and Definitions\\n\\nThe International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. \"[3] Pain is commonly experienced by cancer patients. Its proper assessment requires the following:', \"Measuring pain intensity. Clarifying the impact of pain on patients' psychological, social, spiritual, and existential domains. Establishing treatment adherence and responsiveness. A commonly used approach to pain management employs the three-step World Health Organization (WHO) pain relief ladder, which categorizes pain intensity according to severity and recommends analgesic agents based on their strength. [4] Pain intensity is often assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10. On this scale, 0 indicates no pain, 1 to 3 indicates mild pain, 4 to 6 indicates moderate pain, and 7 to 10 indicates severe pain. [5]\\n\\nFollowing is a summary of the three steps in the WHO cancer pain ladder for adults:\\n\\nStep 1 treats mild pain. Patients in this category receive nonopioid analgesics such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or an adjuvant analgesic, if necessary. Step 2 treats patients experiencing mild to moderate pain who are already taking a nonopioid analgesic, with or without an adjuvant analgesic, but who are still experiencing poor analgesia. Step 2 agents include tramadol and acetaminophen products containing hydrocodone, oxycodone, and codeine. Step 3 treats moderate to severe pain with strong analgesics. Step 3 opioids include morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, levorphanol, methadone, oxymorphone, and oxycodone. The results of an open-label randomized trial of low-dose morphine versus weak opioids to treat moderate cancer pain suggested that it is acceptable to bypass weak opioids and go directly to strong opioids (step 3 agents) for patients with moderate cancer pain, as patients randomly assigned to the low-dose morphine group had more frequent and greater reduction in pain intensity with similarly good tolerability and earlier effect. [6]\\n\\nFamiliarity with opioid pharmacokinetics, equianalgesic dosing, and adverse effects is necessary for their safe and effective use. The appropriate use of adjuvant pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions is needed to optimize pain management.\\n\\nPrevalence\\n\\nPain occurs in 20% to 50% of patients with cancer. [7] Roughly 80% of patients with advanced-stage cancer have moderate to severe pain. [8] One meta-analysis looking at pooled data from 52 studies found that more than half of patients had pain. [9] Younger patients are more likely to experience cancer pain and pain flares than are older patients. [10]\\n\\nCauses of Cancer Pain: Cancer, Cancer Treatments, and Comorbidities\\n\\nA study evaluating the characteristics of patients (N = 100) with advanced cancer presenting to a palliative care service found the primary tumor as the chief cause of pain in 68% of patients. [11] Most pain was somatic, and pain was as likely to be continuous as intermittent.\\n\\nPain can be caused by the following:\\n\\nSurgery. Radiation therapy. Chemotherapy. Targeted therapy. Supportive care therapies. Diagnostic procedures. A systematic review of the literature identified reports of pain occurring in 59% of patients receiving anticancer treatment and in 33% of patients after curative treatments. [9] The prevalence of chronic nonmalignant pain—such as chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis pain, fibromyalgia, and chronic daily headaches—has not been well characterized in cancer patients. It has been reported to range from 2% to 76%, depending on the patient population and how pain was assessed. [12,13,14,15]\\n\\nPostoperative pain\", 'Postoperative pain\\n\\nPain is an expected consequence of surgery. Concerns about the prevalence of opioid misuse have drawn increasing attention to how opioids are prescribed in common settings, including postoperatively. Studies suggest widespread variation in the prescribing patterns of opioids in the postoperative setting. [16] One study of opioid use after orthopedic and general surgery procedures found that, on average, only between 19% and 34% of the opioids prescribed were used and that the quantity of opioids prescribed after a given procedure varied widely by provider. [16] This finding led to the evaluation of utilization data and recommendations for standardizing the quantity of opioids prescribed for five common general surgery procedures. [17] An educational intervention based on those recommendations was associated with a 53% decrease in prescribed opioids after those five general surgery procedures, with only 1 patient in a cohort of 246 patients requiring an opioid refill. [18]\\n\\nThe opioid epidemic has also raised questions about whether postoperative use of opioids can lead to misuse. New persistent opioid use develops in 6% to 8% of opioid-naïve patients after noncancer surgery. [19,20,21] In a large retrospective analysis of patients undergoing curative-intent cancer surgery, 10.4% of opioid-naïve patients developed new persistent opioid use, defined as filling opioid prescriptions 90 to 180 days after surgery. At 1 year postsurgery, these patients were using an average of six 5-mg hydrocodone (or equivalent) tablets per day. Among the risk factors evaluated, only the use of adjuvant chemotherapy increased the risk of new persistent opioid use (15%–21% risk with adjuvant chemotherapy vs. 7%–11% risk with no chemotherapy). [22] In summary, one in ten patients undergoing curative-intent cancer surgery may be at risk of postoperative persistent opioid use.\\n\\nInfusion\\n\\nrelated pain syndromes\\n\\nThe infusion of intravenous chemotherapy causes four pain syndromes:[23,24,25]\\n\\nVenous spasm, which is treated by the application of a warm compress or a decrease in the infusion rate. Chemical phlebitis, which may result from chemotherapy or nonchemotherapy infusions such as potassium chloride and hyperosmolar solutions. [24] Vesicant extravasation, which may cause intense pain followed by desquamation and ulceration. [23] Anthracycline-associated flare, a venous flare reaction that may be caused by doxorubicin and includes local urticaria, pain, or stinging. [25] Some chemotherapy agents such as vinorelbine may cause pain at the tumor site. [26]\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nrelated mucositis\\n\\nSevere mucositis often occurs as a consequence of myeloablative chemotherapy and standard-intensity therapy. [27] Cytotoxic agents commonly associated with mucositis are cytarabine, doxorubicin, etoposide, fluorouracil (5-FU), and methotrexate. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors also cause mucositis. [28,29] Risk factors for mucositis include preexisting oral pathology, poor dental hygiene, and younger age. [27]\\n\\nWhite blood cell growth factor–related bone pain\\n\\nFilgrastim and pegfilgrastim are recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) that increase proliferation and differentiation of neutrophil precursors. Ostealgia is a significant adverse effect caused by G-CSFs that can occur in 20% to 71% of patients. [30] This bone pain starts within 2 days of a pegfilgrastim dose and lasts for 2 to 4 days. Although the mechanism by which G-CSFs cause bone pain is largely unknown, it is hypothesized that histamine release, creating local inflammation and edema, may play a role. A phase II trial randomly assigned patients who had experienced bone pain with pegfilgrastim to receive either daily loratadine 10 mg for 7 days or matching placebo after subsequent doses of pegfilgrastim. [31] There was no statistically significant difference between the two arms.', 'A second phase II trial randomly assigned patients receiving pegfilgrastim to receive naproxen, loratadine, or no preventative medications. [32] The percentage of patients experiencing any grade bone pain was 40.3% in the naproxen group, 42.5% in the loratadine group, and 46.6% in the no-prophylaxis group. Although there was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups, the authors concluded that loratadine administration has a favorable risk-to-benefit profile and should be considered.\\n\\nConventional pain medications have also been studied in this area. A phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of naproxen for the prevention of pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain randomly assigned patients to receive either naproxen 500 mg twice daily for 5 to 8 days after pegfilgrastim administration or placebo. [33] Naproxen reduced overall pain intensity and duration of pain, compared with placebo.\\n\\nChemotherapy\\n\\nrelated musculoskeletal pain\\n\\nPaclitaxel generates a syndrome of diffuse arthralgias and myalgias in 10% to 20% of patients. [34] Diffuse pain in joints and muscles appears 1 to 2 days after the infusion and lasts a median of 4 to 5 days. Pain originates in the back, hips, shoulders, thighs, legs, and feet. Weight bearing, walking, or tactile contact exacerbates the pain. Steroids may reduce the tendency to develop myalgia and arthralgias. Among hormonal therapies, aromatase inhibitors cause musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporotic fractures, arthralgias, and myalgias. [35]\\n\\nDermatologic complications and chemotherapy\\n\\nEGFR inhibitors cause dermatitis with ensuing pain. [36] Acute herpetic neuralgia occurs with a significantly increased incidence among cancer patients, especially those with hematologic malignancies and those receiving immunosuppressive therapies. [37] The pain usually resolves within 2 months but can persist and become postherpetic neuralgia. The palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome is observed in association with continuously infused 5-FU, capecitabine,[38] liposomal doxorubicin,[39] and paclitaxel. [40] Targeted agents such as sorafenib and sunitinib are also associated with hand-foot–like syndrome. [41] Patients develop tingling or burning in their palms and soles, followed by an erythematous rash. Management often requires discontinuing therapy or reducing the treatment dose.\\n\\nSupportive care therapies and pain\\n\\nSupportive care therapies can cause pain, as typified by bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw. [42] Corticosteroid use has also been associated with the development of avascular necrosis. [43]\\n\\nRadiation\\n\\ninduced pain\\n\\nRadiation is associated with several distinct pain syndromes. First, patients may experience pain from brachytherapy and from positioning during treatment (i.e., placement on a radiation treatment table). Second, delayed tissue damage such as mucositis, mucosal inflammation in areas receiving radiation, and dermatitis may be painful. Third, a temporary worsening of pain in the treated area (a pain flare) is a potential side effect of radiation treatment for bone metastases. [44] A randomized trial demonstrated that dexamethasone (8 mg on day of radiation therapy and daily for the following 4 days) reduces the incidence of pain flares, compared with placebo. [45] (Refer to the External-Beam Radiation Therapy section of this summary for more information.)\\n\\nImpact on Function and QOL\\n\\nCancer pain is associated with increased emotional distress. Both pain duration and pain severity correlate with risk of developing depression. Cancer patients are disabled an average of 12 to 20 days per month, with 28% to 55% unable to work because of their cancer. [46] Cancer survivors may experience distress when their pain unexpectedly persists after completion of cancer treatments. [47] Survivors also experience loss of support from their previous health care team as oncologists transition their care back to primary care providers.', 'In one study, between 20% and 50% of cancer patients continued to experience pain and functional limitations years posttreatment. [48] Untreated pain leads to requests for physician-assisted suicide. [49] Untreated pain also leads to unnecessary hospital admissions and visits to emergency departments. [50]', 'Cancer: Controlling Cancer Pain Introduction Having cancer does not mean that you have to live with pain. Cancer and some of the treatments for it can cause pain. But most people who have cancer are able to manage their pain well.footnote1\\n\\nCancer pain can almost always be controlled. Only you know how you feel and how much pain you have. Tell your health care team what your pain feels like and what works and does not work. Don\\'t wait for pain to get bad. Your pain medicine will work best if you use it when you first notice pain, before it becomes bad. If you are taking pain medicine regularly for cancer pain, have a plan (and medicines on hand) for breakthrough pain. This is sudden and intense pain that can happen while you are already taking pain medicine. Many people worry that taking opioid pain medicines will lead to opioid use disorder. Moderate to severe opioid use disorder is sometimes called addiction. Do not let this fear stop you from getting the pain relief you need. Your doctor will monitor you closely for signs of this disorder. Managing your pain can mean treating other problems, too. Uncontrolled cancer pain can lead to anxiety, sleep problems, or depression.\\n\\nHow can I control the pain caused by cancer? Keep track of your pain and your treatments Your doctor needs all the information you can give about what your pain feels like. Your doctor needs to know how your treatment is working or not working. It may be easier to give your doctor information if you write it down. Use a daily diary to rate your pain. Write down what drugs you are taking and how well they are working. Write down any other methods you are using to control your pain.\\n\\nPay attention to the details of your pain so you can tell your doctor. Is it burning? Throbbing? Steady? How long does it last? Take your written information and your questions with you when you see your doctor.\\n\\nUse a calendar or a pain control diary [PDF] to keep track of your treatment. Write down how strong your pain is and when it comes and goes. Most doctors use a \"0 to 10\" scale to measure pain. On this scale, \"0\" means no pain and \"10\" means the worst possible pain.\\n\\nIt is easy to get confused about medicines when you are in pain and are looking for something to help you feel better. You may have prescriptions from more than one doctor. Keeping a written medicine record [PDF] can help you and your doctors work together.\\n\\nStay on top of your pain Your pain will be harder to control if you let it get worse before you take your medicine. Make the most of your pain medicines by following these rules:\\n\\nTake them on time (by the clock). Do not skip a dose or wait until you think you need it. Be prepared for breakthrough pain. You may find that taking your medicine works most of the time, but your pain flares up during extra activity or even for no clear reason. This is called breakthrough pain. Your doctor can give you a prescription for fast-acting medicines that you can take for breakthrough pain. Ask one of your doctors to be your team leader. It is best to have one doctor in charge of all your medicines. If more than one doctor prescribes pain medicine, make sure they talk to each other about it. Manage the side effects Pain medicines may cause side effects. For example, opioid pain relievers may cause drowsiness, constipation, nausea, and vomiting. Some anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, may cause stomach upset or bleeding. Before you start taking a drug, ask your doctor about the possible side effects.\\n\\nThere are things you can do to manage some side effects.', \"There are things you can do to manage some side effects.\\n\\nHome treatment for nausea or vomitingincludes eating clear soups, mild foods, and liquids if you feel nauseated. Watch for and treat early signs of dehydration. Older adults can quickly become dehydrated from vomiting. Home treatment for constipation includes making sure that you drink enough fluids and include fruits, vegetables, and fiber in your diet each day. Do not use a laxative without first talking to your doctor. Complementary medicine Complementary medicine is the term for a wide variety of health care practices that may be used along with standard medical treatment. These therapies are helpful in managing pain for some people.\\n\\nMost of these therapies have not been subjected to the same degree of rigorous scientific testing for safety and effectiveness that standard medical treatments must go through before they are approved in the United States. Be sure to talk with your doctor about which therapies might be best for you.\\n\\nBehavioral therapies\\n\\nBiofeedback is a method of consciously controlling a body function that is normally controlled unconsciously, such as skin temperature, muscle tension, heart rate, or blood pressure. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a type of counseling that can help you cope with pain by modifying certain thought and behavior patterns. Relaxation exercises can help reduce tension and stress. Physical therapies\\n\\nTai chi, yoga, and other forms of movement can help you keep your strength, flexibility, and mobility. Heat and cold treatments relieve sore muscles and decrease pain. Massage helps reduce tension and pain, improves circulation, and encourages relaxation. Other therapies\\n\\nAcupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine. It is done by inserting very thin needles into the skin at certain points on the body. Acupuncture may help relieve pain.footnote2 Aromatherapy is the therapeutic use of aroma-producing oils (essential oils) extracted from a plant's flowers, leaves, stalks, bark, rind, or roots. These oils are mixed with another substance, such as oil, alcohol, or lotion, and then applied to the skin, sprayed in the air, or inhaled. Healing touch is the conscious influence of one person on another, without physical means of intervention, to benefit the recipient's physical or emotional well-being. Meditation is the practice of focusing your attention to alter your state of consciousness, usually directed toward feeling calm and having a clear awareness about your life.\", 'Cancer Prevention Overview (PDQ®): Prevention - Health Professional Information [NCI] This information is produced and provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

This can be accomplished by avoiding a carcinogen or altering its metabolism; pursuing lifestyle or dietary practices that modify cancer-causing factors or genetic predispositions; medical interventions (e.g., chemoprevention) or risk-reducing surgical procedures; or early detection strategies that can result in removal of precancerous lesions, such as colonoscopy for colorectal polyps.\\n\\nAbout the PDQ Cancer Prevention Summaries\\n\\nThe PDQ cancer prevention summaries are primarily organized by specific anatomic cancer site to facilitate consideration of the unique characteristics of specific malignancies. In this section, an overview of cancer prevention strategies is provided, including a summary of evidence for selected preventive strategies used in the prevention of a broad spectrum of malignancies. The strength of evidence and magnitude of effects of these strategies, however, may vary by cancer site. Other PDQ cancer prevention summaries address the prevention of specific types of cancer and provide more detailed descriptions of the evidence.\\n\\nThere are many common beliefs or speculations about causes of cancer. However, putative causes of cancer for which there exist very little scientific evidence, positive or negative, are not considered in these summaries. Therefore, absence of an environmental, dietary, or lifestyle factor from these summaries implies insufficient evidence for detailed consideration and not necessarily absence of effect. Many such factors are deserving of research regarding their potential roles in cancer, but if that research does not exist, has not been published, or the Editorial Board judges the research to be of insufficient quantity or of poor quality, they are not addressed in these summaries.\\n\\nCarcinogenesis\\n\\nCarcinogenesis refers to an underlying etiologic pathway that leads to cancer. Several models of carcinogenesis have been proposed. Knudson proposed a \"two-hit\" model requiring a mutation in both copies of a gene resulting in cancer. Expansion of this concept has resulted in other widely cited models of carcinogenesis including those of Vogelstein and Kinzler [1] and Hanahan and Weinberg. [2] The model of Vogelstein and Kinzler emphasizes that cancer is ultimately a disease of damaged DNA, comprised of a series of genetic mutations that can transform normal cells to cancerous cells. The genetic mutations include inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes. Compared with cancers arising in the general population, individuals with a major inherited predisposition to cancer are born with inherited (i.e., germline) mutations in genes involved in cancer causation, giving them a head start on the pathway to cancer. Similar mutations would be expected to result in cancer progression among all individuals; however, in those without a major inherited cancer predisposition, the mutation would occur as a somatic mutation later during their lifetime.', \"The model of Hanahan and Weinberg focuses on the hallmark events at the cellular level that lead to a malignant tumor. In this model, the hallmarks of cancer include sustained angiogenesis, limitless replicative potential, evading apoptosis, self-sufficiency in growth signals, and insensitivity to antigrowth signals, leading to the defining characteristics of malignant tumors, which give them the ability to invade and metastasize. This model highlights the fact that malignant tumors arise and flourish within the environment of a whole organism. The tissue organizational field theory [3] posits that carcinogenesis is better conceptualized at the level of tissues rather than cells. This theory is based on the dual premise that carcinogenesis is driven by defects in tissue organization and that all cells are inherently in a proliferative state.\\n\\nModels of carcinogenesis such as these are purposefully simplistic but, nevertheless, illustrate that carcinogenesis requires a constellation of steps that often take place for decades.\\n\\nThe complexity of carcinogenesis is magnified when one considers that the specific details of the carcinogenic pathway described by these models would be expected to have unique characteristics for each anatomic site. Under these circumstances, the risk factors and clinical characteristics of malignancies exhibit considerable variation by anatomic site and by different tumor types within the same anatomic site. For these reasons, human cancer is really not a single disease but is a family of different diseases.\\n\\nRisk Factors\\n\\nThe promise for cancer prevention is derived from observational epidemiologic studies that show associations between modifiable lifestyle factors or environmental exposures and specific cancers. The expectation is that, if a risk factor truly causes cancer, it would also be the case that a lifestyle modification (i.e., changing one's risk profile from bad to good) would actually reduce cancer risk, at least partially. This expectation can be fulfilled only if the association is due to a causal (and ideally, reversible) relationship. Because observational studies rarely provide conclusive evidence of such relationships, additional evidence is required. [4] For a few exposures, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have tested whether interventions suggested by epidemiologic studies and leads based on laboratory research result in reduced cancer incidence and mortality.\\n\\nRisk factors causally associated with cancer\\n\\nCigarette smoking/tobacco use\\n\\nDecades of research have consistently established the strong association between tobacco use and cancers of many sites. Specifically, cigarette smoking has been established as a cause of a range of cancers; including lung, oral cavity, esophageal, bladder, kidney, pancreatic, stomach, and cervical cancers, and acute myelogenous leukemia. The body of epidemiologic evidence confirming these associations is substantial. Further support is demonstrated by the lung cancer death rates in the United States, which have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men. As a single exposure that is relatively easy to measure accurately, this extensive body of evidence has led to the estimation that cigarette smoking causes 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States. Smoking avoidance and smoking cessation result in decreased incidence and mortality from cancer. [5] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Lung Cancer Prevention; Lung Cancer Screening; and Cigarette Smoking: Health Risks and How to Quit for more information.)\\n\\nInfections\", \"Infections\\n\\nGlobally, infectious agents have been estimated to cause about 15% of all cancer cases. [6,7] The burden of cancers caused by infections is much greater in developing nations (26%) than in developed nations (8%). Infection with an oncogenic strain of human papillomavirus (HPV) is considered a necessary event for subsequent cervical cancer, and vaccine-conferred immunity results in a marked decrease in precancerous lesions. Oncogenic strains of HPV are also linked with cancers of the penis, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Other examples of infectious agents that cause cancer are hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (liver cancer), Epstein-Barr virus (Burkitt lymphoma), and Helicobacter pylori (gastric cancer). [7] If an infectious agent is truly a cause of cancer, then efficacious, anti-infective interventions would be expected in most instances to be effective cancer-prevention interventions. This is the expectation with vaccines that protect against infection with oncogenic strains of HPV. (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Cervical Cancer Prevention; Cervical Cancer Screening; Liver (Hepatocellular) Cancer Prevention; and Liver (Hepatocellular) Cancer Screening for more information.)\\n\\nRadiation\\n\\nRadiation is energy in the form of high-speed particles or electromagnetic waves. Exposure to radiation, primarily ultraviolet (UV) radiation and ionizing radiation, is a clearly established cause of cancer. Exposure to solar UV radiation is the major cause of nonmelanoma skin cancers, which are by far the most common malignancies in human populations. [8]\\n\\nIonizing radiation is radiation with enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from their orbits, causing atoms to become charged or ionized. Ions formed in the molecules of living cells can go on to react with and potentially damage other molecules in the cell. At low doses (e.g., those associated with background radiation), the cells repair the damage rapidly. At moderate doses, the cells may be changed permanently or die from their inability to repair the damage. Cells changed permanently may go on to produce abnormal cells when they divide, and in some circumstances, these altered cells may become cancerous or lead to other abnormalities (e.g., birth defects). Defects in ability to repair damage caused by ionizing radiation may influence the impact of radiation exposure on cancer risk.\\n\\nThere is extensive epidemiologic and biologic evidence that links exposure to ionizing radiation with the development of cancer, and in particular, cancer that involves the hematological system, breast, lungs, and thyroid. The National Research Council of the National Academies' Committee to Assess the Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation report, the Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII,[9] the most widely cited source on the topic, concluded after a comprehensive review of the medical literature that no dose of radiation should be considered completely safe, and attempts should be made to keep radiation doses as low as possible. In this report, several lines of evidence were cited documenting the association between ionizing radiation exposure and cancer. The first line of evidence comes from studies of the development of cancer among Japanese atomic-bomb survivors. Even at low doses of radiation, atomic-bomb survivors were at increased risk of developing cancer. [9] The second line of evidence comes from epidemiological studies of medically irradiated populations who were therapeutically irradiated for both malignant and benign diseases. Following high-dose radiation therapy for malignant disease, the risk of secondary malignancy is high. The relatively common use of radiation for benign disease between 1940 and 1960 resulted in a substantially increased relative risk (RR) of developing cancer.\\n\\nAn additional line of evidence comes from an increased risk of cancer-specific mortality associated with exposure to medical ionizing radiation, for both the recipients of diagnostic x-rays and x-ray personnel.\", \"The major sources of population exposure to ionizing radiation are medical radiation (including x-rays, computed tomography [CT], fluoroscopy, and nuclear medicine) and naturally occurring radon gas in the basements of homes. Limiting unnecessary CT scans and other diagnostic studies, as well as reducing radiation exposure doses, are important prevention strategies. [10,11] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Breast Cancer Prevention; Breast Cancer Screening; Skin Cancer Prevention; and Lung Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nExposure to ionizing radiation has increased during the last two decades as a result of the dramatic increase in the use of CT. Exposure to ionizing radiation associated with CT is in the range where carcinogenesis has been demonstrated. [12,13] Repeat exposure to radiation from medical imaging will further increase cancer risk, because risk is proportional to exposure. One study found that half the subjects who were exposed to radiation from medical imaging underwent repeat imaging within 3 years. Overall, 0.2% of the nearly 1 million participants followed for 3 years received doses above 50 mSv. [14]\\n\\nOne approach to estimate the potential contribution of exposure to ionizing radiation from medical imaging is to develop statistical models based on the estimated cancer risks associated with a range of dose levels. For example, one estimate of the CT scans performed in the United States in 2007 predicted that 29,000 (95% uncertainty limits of 15,000–45,000) cancers might result in the future. One-third of the projected cancers were caused by CT scans done on individuals aged 35 to 54 years. This estimate was derived from risk models based on organ-specific radiation doses from national surveys, frequency of CT scans in 2007 by age and sex from survey and insurance claim data, and the National Research Council of the National Academies' report, Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation. [12]\\n\\nData are now emerging from studies large enough to directly estimate the cancer risk associated with diagnostic imaging using ionizing radiation. For example, in a cohort of 10.9 million Australians, electronic medical records were used to document the diagnostic CT scans of youths who received CT scans when they were aged 0 to 19 years. This cohort was then linked to the National Death Index and Australian Cancer Database. [15] Compared with those who did not have a CT scan, those who had at least one CT scan were statistically significantly more likely to be diagnosed with cancer as they were followed into young adulthood (RR, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20–1.29; average follow-up in those who had a CT was 9.5 years). A statistically significant dose-response relationship was observed, with cancer risk increasing with each additional CT scan. Thus, the findings of cohort studies with directly measured CT scans now substantiate the statistical models and document the real-world cancer risks associated with exposure to ionizing radiation via medical imaging.\\n\\nDiagnostic imaging in childhood and adolescence is even associated with an elevated risk of a broad range of solid and hematologic malignancies at a young age. In a population-based South Korean cohort of more than 12 million children aged 0 to 19 years, the incidence rate ratio of cancers in the 10.6% of those exposed to diagnostic radiation was 1.64 after a lag period of 2 years since exposure (95% CI, 1.56–1.73; P < .001), compared with those who had no exposure. [16]\\n\\nImmunosuppression after organ transplantation\", 'Immunosuppression after organ transplantation\\n\\nMedications that suppress the immune system in patients undergoing organ transplantation are associated with an increased cancer risk. [17] A retrospective population-based cohort study of solid-organ transplant recipients in Ontario, Canada, during a 20-year period demonstrated that solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of cancer-specific death, regardless of age, sex, and organ transplanted. The risk is higher during the first 6 months posttransplant but persists for many years. It is especially high for cancers linked to viral infections. As outcomes of transplantation have improved, cancer mortality from secondary cancers has increased and is now the second most common cause of death after transplantation. [18]\\n\\nRisk/protective factors with uncertain associations with cancer\\n\\nDiet\\n\\nEstimates concerning the potential contribution of diet to the population burden of cancer have varied widely. [19] In contrast to the epidemiologic evidence on cigarette smoking and cancer, evidence for the influence of dietary factors and cancer is uncertain. An assessment of the potential role of diet entails measuring the net contribution of diets, comprising factors that may protect against cancer and other factors that may increase cancer risk. Measuring an individual\\'s usual diet and its direct relevance to cancer risk also poses challenges. [20]\\n\\nExamples in which the type of study design led to substantively different results further illustrate the complexities of the relationship between food and nutrient intake and human cancer risk. Observational epidemiologic studies (case-control and cohort studies), which used self-reported dietary assessments that are prone to substantial measurement error, have suggested associations between diet and cancer development, but randomized trials of interventions provided little or no support. For example, on the basis of population-based epidemiologic data, high-fiber diets were recommended to prevent colon neoplasms. However, a 2017 Cochrane database systematic review of RCTs of supplemental fiber found a lack of evidence to suggest that increased dietary fiber intake will reduce the recurrence of adenomatous polyps in those with a history of adenomatous polyps within a 2- to 8-year period. [21] Likewise, systematic evidence reviews of cohort studies,[22,23] and randomized trials [24], found small or uncertain effects of red meat intake or reduction in intake on overall cancer incidence and mortality. The overall quality of evidence was graded as low to very low.\\n\\nAssociations reported from observational epidemiologic analysis based on self-reported assessments should be viewed in the context of the limitations as described in the above text. On the other hand, stronger evidence of causal relationships is unlikely to be provided by relatively short-term RCTs, especially if life-long dietary patterns or dietary intake during specific life stages are most important in inducing or preventing cancer.\\n\\nAlcohol\\n\\nWith respect to dietary factors that may increase cancer risk, the strongest evidence in the World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) report was for drinking alcohol. The evidence was judged to be \"convincing\" that drinking alcohol increased the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, breast, and colorectum (the latter in men). Further, the evidence was judged to be \"probable\" that drinking alcohol increased the risk of liver cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC) (the latter in women).\\n\\nIn relation to human cancer, diets reflect the sum total of a complex mixture of exposures, as demonstrated by the examples of fruit/vegetable intake and alcohol consumption. No dietary factors appear to be uniformly relevant to all forms of cancer. (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Breast Cancer Prevention; Colorectal Cancer Prevention; and Lung Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nPhysical activity', 'Physical activity\\n\\nA growing body of epidemiologic evidence suggests that people who are more physically active have a lower risk of certain malignancies than those who are more sedentary. In the WCRF/AICR report, the evidence was judged to be \"convincing\" that increased physical activity protects against CRC. The evidence was also judged to be \"probable\" that physical activity was associated with lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer and endometrial cancer. As with the dietary factors described above, physical activity seems to play a more prominent role in selected malignancies. The inverse associations observed for selected malignancies make this a promising area for cancer prevention research, particularly because causal associations have not been established. The excess risk of many cancers seen with obesity, in combination with evidence to suggest that physical activity is inversely associated with at least a few cancers, raises the hypothesis that energy balance may influence cancer risk. (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Breast Cancer Prevention; Colorectal Cancer Prevention; and Endometrial Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nObesity\\n\\nObesity is being increasingly recognized as an important cancer risk factor. The WCRF/AICR report concluded that obesity is convincingly linked to postmenopausal breast cancer and cancers of the esophagus, pancreas, colorectum, endometrium, and kidney. Furthermore, the WCRF/AICR report judged body fatness to be a probable risk factor for cancer of the gallbladder and the evidence to be \"limited suggestive\" for liver cancer. These conclusions from the WCRF/AICR evidence review were corroborated in a cohort study based on medical records data from 5.24 million adults in the United Kingdom. [25] The results of this U.K. cohort study also bolstered the evidence for an association between body mass index (BMI) and cancer of the gall bladder (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1–1.5 per 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI) and for liver cancer (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.12–1.27 per 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI). [25] A prospective study of nationally representative cohorts that examined obesity in relation to cancer mortality emphasized that factors associated with cancer do not uniformly apply to all human malignancies. The study results revealed that obesity was associated with an increased risk of dying from obesity-associated malignancies, but obesity was not associated with overall cancer mortality.\\n\\n[26] If the associations between obesity and the cancers mentioned above are causal, which has yet to be established, the current increase in the prevalence of obesity in the United States and elsewhere poses a severe challenge to cancer prevention efforts. The magnitude of the impact of obesity on public health and the population burden of cancer is likely to be substantial, but is expected to be less than that of cigarette smoking. Smoking has a high prevalence and is causally associated with 13 types of cancer, and the magnitude of the associations are often much stronger than those observed for obesity. Furthermore, weight loss has yet to be shown to reduce the risk of obesity-associated malignancies. [27] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Breast Cancer Prevention; Colorectal Cancer Prevention; Endometrial Cancer Prevention; and Lung Cancer Prevention for more information.)', 'A recent analysis [4] of the long-running Nurses\\' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study estimated the proportions of cancer cases and deaths in the U.S. population on the basis of adoption of a low-risk lifestyle (characterized by being a never-smoker or former smoker, drinking alcohol moderately or not at all, having a BMI between 18.5 and 27.5, and meeting the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans). One major weakness of the study was that its premise assumed the causality of the nonsmoking risk factors. The analysis was further weakened by using self-reported measures of diet and alcohol use, and by measuring only leisure-time (rather than all) physical activity. Also, the authors did not present the effects of the nonsmoking risk factors after accounting for smoking. This analysis and others with similar weaknesses should therefore be interpreted cautiously.\\n\\nDiabetes\\n\\nObservational studies suggest that all-cancer incidence and mortality are slightly increased (10%–15%) in individuals with diabetes, although the increase is greater for certain organ sites and null for others. [28,29,30] Given that there is biologic heterogeneity in diabetes and cancer, that diabetes and cancer share a number of risk factors, and that diabetes almost always requires long-term medication use, it is not possible to say what the observed associations (especially those that are small) actually represent. Furthermore, most observational studies rely on self-reports of diabetes (as \"has diabetes\" or \"does not have diabetes\"), making it impossible to explore whether associations differ by diabetic type or severity, degree of diabetic control, and other factors that can be determined only through the use of biospecimens and repeated measures. These limitations must be kept in mind when findings are interpreted.\\n\\nAt least four of the following characteristics of diabetes have been hypothesized to increase cancer risk:\\n\\nHyperinsulinemia (including insulin resistance). Hyperglycemia. Downregulation of sex hormone–binding globulin. Chronic inflammation. Diabetes and cancer share a number of risk factors, including aging, obesity, smoking, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity. [5] Diabetes treatments include exogenous insulin injections, as well as oral medications that modify insulin secretion and sensitivity, reduce blood glucose levels, or prevent the kidneys from reabsorbing blood glucose. [31]\\n\\nIn prospective observational studies, risk of, and death due to, liver, pancreas, colon/colorectum, and female breast cancer are consistently higher in persons with diabetes. Increases in risk or death also have been observed for cancer of the endometrium, ovary, bladder, and oral cavity/pharynx. In a prospective cohort with long-term follow-up of more than a million U.S. adults [29]—with analyses that controlled for age, education, BMI, smoking, alcohol intake, vegetable intake, red meat intake, physical activity, and aspirin use—the greatest increase in mortality for the aforementioned cancer sites was for liver cancer in males (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.89–2.70); the lowest was for breast cancer in females (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03–1.29). With the exception of death due to male breast cancer (analysis included 12 patients with diabetes who were dying of the cancer), the remainder of positive statistically significant RRs were no greater than 1.5. A pooled data analysis of 97 prospective studies (almost 821,000 individuals) that controlled for age, smoking status, and BMI, and presented non–sex-stratified hazard ratios (HRs),[28] reported findings similar to those in the aforementioned study; however, contrary to that study, increases in risk of death caused by lung (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.13–1.43) and ovarian cancer (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.03–2.02) were found.', \"An umbrella review of meta-analyses [30] of type 2 diabetes and cancer reported a statistically significant 10% increase in risk of all-cancer incidence, a statistically significant 16% increase in all-cancer mortality, and statistically significant increases in the incidence of 12 cancers. Relative increases in the incidence of pancreas, endometrium, and liver cancer were roughly twofold and statistically significant.\\n\\nMetformin has been associated with a decrease in breast cancer incidence and mortality in observational studies and is currently under study in clinical trials. Metformin has been hypothesized to reduce risk by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation through adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–kinase activation. The use of medications that affect incretin receptor signaling has been postulated to increase pancreatic cancer incidence, but neither animal nor clinical data (which are limited) support this claim at this time. [32] Long-term use of exogenous, long-acting insulin has never consistently been shown to increase cancer risk.\\n\\nThe impact of screen detection on measures of risk\\n\\nMany of the groundbreaking observational studies in cancer etiology date back to a time when widespread cancer screening did not occur. Given the extensive uptake of screening for certain cancers over the past quarter-century, recently conducted observational etiologic studies included participants whose disease was detected through screening. When overdiagnosis exists with screening, and screening behavior or willingness to seek diagnostic evaluation is correlated with cancer risk factors, relative risk measures generated from today's etiology studies may not agree with those from studies conducted before the widespread use of screening. This is because overdiagnosed cases would never have been diagnosed in the absence of screening. For example, assume that blue eyes (relative to brown eyes) are associated with receiving prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening or preference for diagnostic biopsy, but not with prostate cancer. In the absence of screening, a null result would have been observed for the association of blue eyes and prostate cancer. In the presence of screening, blue eyes would be associated with prostate cancer, because blue eyes would lead to screening, and screening would detect overdiagnosed cases. [33]\\n\\nInterventions With Proven Benefits\\n\\nChemoprevention\\n\\nChemoprevention refers to the use of natural or synthetic compounds to interfere with early stages of carcinogenesis, before invasive cancer appears. [34] Several agents have proven benefit.\\n\\nSelective estrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen and raloxifene), taken daily for up to 5 years, reduce breast cancer incidence by 50% in high-risk women. [34] Widespread use of these medications for prevention is limited because of side effects (hot flashes, and in the case of tamoxifen, endometrial cancer). (Refer to the PDQ summary on Breast Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nFinasteride (an alpha-reductase inhibitor) lowers the incidence of prostate cancer. [35] Finasteride lowers PSA levels, resulting in fewer prostate biopsies, and shrinks normal prostate tissue, which allows easier detection of cancers. Both of these effects may account for the finding that finasteride recipients have an absolute higher incidence of high-grade prostate cancer, i.e., a lower incidence of low-risk cancer (lower overdiagnosis). Long-term follow-up (median, 18 years) after completion of the 7-year treatment intervention in the finasteride randomized trial demonstrated that there was a continued reduction in prostate cancer risk. Concerns regarding the increased number of high-grade tumors have been addressed with the long-term evidence of no increased risk of prostate cancer mortality in men who received finasteride (HR for risk of prostate cancer death, finasteride vs. placebo, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.50–1.12). [36] (Refer to the PDQ summary on Prostate Cancer Prevention for more information.)\", 'COX-2 inhibitors inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins. Evidence suggests that COX-2 inhibitors may prevent colon and breast cancer but concerns about cardiovascular risk preclude extensive study. An RCT of moderately high-dose celecoxib in patients with arthritis showed no difference in cardiovascular outcomes when compared with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). [37] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Breast Cancer Prevention and Colorectal Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nAspirin has been studied extensively as a chemopreventive agent. However, the evidence of benefit for the prevention of cancer or cancer deaths in the general population is mixed, but generally negative. A secondary analysis of pooled data from seven placebo-controlled RCTs with primary endpoints of vascular events showed that daily aspirin for at least 4 years reduced overall cancer deaths by 18% (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70–0.95). [38] The effect of aspirin on cancer incidence seems to be limited to CRC in this analysis. A more recent meta-analysis of 16 RCTs, with a mean follow-up of 5.48 years (range, 2–10.7 years) that compared aspirin (doses varying from 81–1,200 mg daily) with placebo controls did not reveal favorable effects of aspirin on cancer mortality (RR, 0.99; 95% CI 0.87–1.12), all-cause mortality (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.92–1.02), or cancer incidence (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.04). [39]\\n\\nA secondary analysis of cancer outcomes in a placebo-controlled RCT of aspirin/omega-3 fatty acid chemoprevention for cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus found no evidence of reduced gastrointestinal cancer risk caused by aspirin use, although the authors noted that the power to detect differences in cancer rates was low. [40] Only one randomized trial of aspirin for primary prevention focused on older individuals without a specific indication to take aspirin, and it suggests that aspirin use may have an adverse effect on cancer outcomes in the elderly. The Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial included study participants aged 70 years and older (≥65 years for African-Americans and Hispanics in the United States) who did not have cardiovascular disease, dementia, or disability. In contrast to other randomized trials of aspirin, an increase in all-cause mortality (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01–1.29) and risk of cancer death (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10–1.56) were observed in the aspirin group. An accompanying editorial highlighted that the follow-up time was slightly shorter than other similar trials and that results with continued follow-up will be informative. Additional characteristics of the trial included a study population that appeared to be healthier than the general population, and mortality rates that were lower in the study group compared with the general population of similar age, sex, and race/ethnicity distribution.\\n\\nAt year 5 of the trial, no evidence of a net benefit has been shown in this healthy population with no underlying reason or medical indications for aspirin use. [41,42] Of note, aspirin use was associated with a trend toward an increased risk of metastatic cancers (6.1 vs. 5.1 per 1,000 person-years; HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00–1.43), which tended to be metastatic at diagnosis. Post hoc analysis showed that aspirin use was also associated with a higher risk of death with cancers that presented at stages III (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.03–4.33) or IV (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.04–1.64), suggesting that aspirin use may accelerate cancer progression in the elderly. [43] A significant side effect of aspirin use is bleeding, which may preclude widespread use for cancer prevention. Evidence of harm from bleeding, including major bleeding, is more consistent than the evidence of benefit summarized above.', \"Because aspirin may help reduce death from cardiovascular disease (which is responsible for more deaths than cancer), use of aspirin should be considered in a larger context of prevention beyond cancer. Similarly, serious harms from bleeding (from the gastrointestinal tract or intracranially) should be considered in light of patients' individual risks of specific harms. (Refer to the PDQ summary on Colorectal Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nInterventions With No Proven Benefit\\n\\nVitamin and dietary supplement use\\n\\nSome have advocated vitamin and mineral supplements for cancer prevention. Many different mechanistic pathways for anticancer effects have been invoked. A commonly tested hypothesis is that antioxidant vitamins may protect against cancer, based on the premise that oxidative damage to DNA leads to cancer progression. Hence preventing oxidative DNA damage would prevent progression to cancer. However, the evidence is insufficient to support the use of multivitamin and mineral supplements or single vitamins or minerals to prevent cancer. [44] Beta carotene is an antioxidant that was thought to prevent or reverse smoking-related changes leading to lung cancer based on the results of several observational epidemiologic studies examining either dietary intake of beta carotene from food sources or blood levels as a marker of dietary intake. [45] However, two prospective, placebo-controlled trials found that smokers and former smokers who received beta carotene supplements had increased lung cancer incidence and mortality. [46]\\n\\nOther unanticipated adverse events have been documented for dietary supplement use. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of daily doses of calcium greater than or equal to 500 mg/day versus placebo documented that calcium supplements were associated with a significantly elevated risk of myocardial infarction (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01–1.59). [47] Dietary calcium intake has not been observed to be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. [48] The discrepancy in findings between calcium in the diet versus high-dose supplementation raises questions about the value of dietary supplements compared with dietary intake. The Iowa Women's Health Study, an observational study that enrolled over 40,000 women aged 55 to 69 years in 1986, examined the association between dietary supplement use and mortality. [49] Statistically significant excess mortality risk was observed with the use of multivitamins, vitamin B6, folic acid, iron, magnesium, zinc, and copper. Only calcium users were associated with a statistically significant reduction in mortality rates compared with nonusers.\\n\\nResearch into the potential anticancer properties of vitamin and mineral supplements is ongoing, and the results continue to reinforce the lack of efficacy of vitamin supplements in preventing cancer. The extended follow-up results of the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) found a statistically significant excess risk of prostate cancer associated with vitamin E supplementation (400 IU/day of all rac -α-tocopherol acetate) compared with placebo (HR, 1.17; 99% CI, 1.0004–1.36; P = .008). The absolute increase in risk of prostate cancer with vitamin E use was 1.6 per 1,000 person-years. Selenium did not reduce the risk of prostate cancer (HR, 1.09; 99% CI, 0.93–1.27). [50]\\n\\nThe results of the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) II demonstrated that supplementation with vitamin E and/or vitamin C had no benefit compared with placebo in preventing either prostate cancer incidence or total cancer incidence. [51]\", \"The results of the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study indicated that, compared with placebo, supplementation with vitamin C, vitamin E, or beta carotene was not efficacious in reducing total cancer incidence. [52] In this same study, daily supplements containing folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 were compared with placebo; this intervention was not efficacious in reducing the overall risk of developing cancer. [53] An exploratory analysis of pooled data from two Norwegian RCTs showed an increase in both cancer incidence and cancer death in patients treated with folic acid and vitamin B12 versus those receiving placebo or vitamin B6 alone. [54] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on Breast Cancer Prevention; Colorectal Cancer Prevention; Lung Cancer Prevention; and Prostate Cancer Prevention for more information.)\\n\\nVitamin D has also generated interest as a potential anticancer agent. Sources of vitamin D include cutaneous synthesis upon exposure to sunlight, dietary intake, and supplements. Evidence for the efficacy of vitamin D supplements with or without calcium in preventing cancer incidence is available as a secondary endpoint from RCTs, with a summary of the results from three trials providing evidence of lack of efficacy. [55] A fourth RCT further corroborates this lack of cancer chemopreventive effect. [56] The overall body of experimental evidence from these studies in humans indicates that at the doses studied (range, 400–1,100 IU daily), vitamin D supplements do not reduce or increase the overall risk of cancer. [57,58] The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), a placebo-controlled trial of two forms of supplementation (2,000 IU/day of vitamin D and 1g/day of omega-3 fatty acids), found that neither type of supplementation resulted in lower incidence of invasive cancer. Because invasive cancer incidence was one of the primary endpoints of VITAL (with major cardiovascular events as the coprimary endpoint), the null results of VITAL provided strong additional evidence that even large doses of supplemental vitamin D have no discernible impact on cancer.\\n\\n[58,59,60,61] The VITAL findings concerning omega-3 fatty acids agree with those from a secondary analysis of cancer outcomes in a placebo-controlled RCT of aspirin/omega-3 fatty acid chemoprevention for cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus. [62]\\n\\nNone of the RCTs mentioned above studied multivitamin supplements as commonly taken by the general U.S. population; however, a separate arm of the PHS II directly studied this question. In the PHS II, 14,641 male physicians were randomly assigned to receive either a daily multivitamin supplement or a placebo for a median of 11 years. [63] Multivitamin supplements were associated with an 8% relative decrease in cancer incidence (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86–0.998; P = .04). The overall reduction in cancer risk was more pronounced in men who had been diagnosed with cancer before the study began (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.88) than in those with no history of cancer (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.87–1.03), suggesting that the small benefit of multivitamins in reducing overall cancer incidence largely stemmed from the prevention of second primary cancers. This puzzling result, along with the weak association and multiple statistical comparisons made for many different trial endpoints, diminishes the strength of evidence provided by the PHS II trial. Of note, no significant association between multivitamin use and total mortality was observed in the PHS II (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88–1.02; P = .13), suggesting neither a negative nor positive effect on life span. [64] This finding differs from the association between supplements and higher mortality reported in the observational Iowa Women's Health Study. [49]\\n\\nEnvironmental Exposures and Pollutants\", 'Environmental Exposures and Pollutants\\n\\nThe relationship between environmental pollutants and cancer risk has been of long-standing interest to researchers and the public. When estimates of the potential burden of cancer have been calculated for different classes of exposure, the factors described earlier, such as cigarette smoking and infections, have represented much greater proportions of the cancer burden than have environmental pollutants. Nevertheless, some associations between environmental pollutants and cancer have been clearly established. Perhaps because the lung is most heavily exposed to air pollutants, many of the most firmly established examples of pollutants and cancer relate specifically to lung cancer, including secondhand tobacco smoke, indoor radon, outdoor air pollution, and asbestos for mesothelioma. Another environmental pollutant linked with cancer is highly concentrated inorganic arsenic in drinking water, which is causally associated with cancers of the skin, bladder, and lung. Many other environmental pollutants, such as pesticides, have been assessed for risk with human cancer, but with indeterminate results. There are challenging methodological issues to address in these studies, such as accurately measuring exposures for long periods, which often make it difficult to clearly establish an association between an environmental pollutant and cancer.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThe list of topics considered above is not exhaustive. Other lifestyle and environmental factors known to affect cancer risk (either beneficially or detrimentally) include certain sexual and reproductive practices, the use of exogenous estrogens, and certain occupational and chemical exposures.\\n\\nIn this summary, factors were selected that appear to impact the risk of several types of cancer and that have been identified as being potentially modifiable. These include cigarette smoking, which has been conclusively linked with a wide range of malignancies; avoidance of cigarette smoking has been shown to reduce cancer incidence. Other potential modifiable cancer risk factors include alcohol consumption and obesity; physical activity is inversely associated with the risk of certain cancers. More research is needed to determine whether these associations are causal and whether avoiding risk behaviors or increasing protective behaviors would actually reduce cancer incidence.', 'Ambulatory Electrocardiogram (EKG) Test Overview An ambulatory electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) records the electrical activity of your heart while you do your usual activities. Ambulatory means that you are able to walk during the test. This type of monitoring may also be called ambulatory EKG, Holter monitoring, 24-hour EKG, or cardiac event monitoring.\\n\\nMany heart problems are noticeable only during certain activities. These include exercise, eating, sex, stress, bowel movements, and even sleeping. An ambulatory electrocardiogram is more likely to find abnormal heartbeats that occur during these activities.\\n\\nMany people have irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) from time to time. What this means depends on the type of pattern they produce, how often they occur, how long they last, and whether they occur at the same time you have symptoms. Because arrhythmias can come and go, it may be hard to record one while you are in the doctor\\'s office.\\n\\nThere are several different types of ambulatory monitors. Your doctor will choose the type that works best for you and is most likely to help diagnose your heart problem.\\n\\nAmbulatory EKG monitoring is done to:\\n\\nLook for and record irregular heartbeats that come and go or happen during certain activities. Find out what is causing chest pain or pressure, dizziness, or fainting. These may be symptoms of heart problems. Check to see if treatment for an irregular heartbeat is working.\\n\\nHow you prepare may depend on the type of monitor you are getting.\\n\\nBe sure to tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, even over-the-counter ones. Many medicines can change the results of this test.\\n\\nIf you\\'re going to have electrode pads or a patch, take a shower or bath before the patch or pads are put on. You may not be able to get the pads or patch wet during the test. Your doctor will instruct you on how to wear the electrodes. Wear a loose blouse or shirt.\\n\\nIf you\\'re getting a monitor put under your skin, you will get instructions on how to prepare for the procedure.\\n\\nYour doctor will choose the type of heart monitor and explain the details of how to use it. If you have to do anything to send your heart data, your doctor will show you how.\\n\\nWhat you do during the test Your doctor may ask you to keep a diary of all of your activities and symptoms while you wear the monitor. You will write down the type of activity you were doing and the time your symptoms started. For example, write down the exact times when you:\\n\\nExercise or climb stairs. Eat. Urinate or have a bowel movement. Have sex. Sleep. Get upset. Take medicine. If you have any symptoms of heart problems, such as dizziness, fainting, chest pain, or abnormal heartbeats, push the event-marker button on the recorder to mark it (if you have the type that allows you to). Then write down the exact time and how long the symptom lasts. For example, you might write: \"12:30 p.m. Ate lunch. 1:00 p.m. Argument with boss, had chest tightness for several minutes.\"\\n\\nIf one of the electrodes or lead wires comes loose, a light on the monitor will flash. Press on the center of each electrode to see if you can restore the contact. Call your doctor if one of the electrodes comes off and you can\\'t get it to stay on.\\n\\nYour doctor will tell you if you need to stay away from strong electromagnetic fields while wearing a monitor. This may include magnets, microwave ovens, and electric blankets. Signals from these types of electronic equipment can sometimes affect the recording.\\n\\nWhat you and your doctor do after the test At the end of the recording period, your doctor will give you instructions. If you had electrode pads or a patch, you may go to the doctor\\'s office or hospital to have them removed. Or you may be able to remove them yourself. Your doctor will let you know how to return the monitor.\\n\\nYour doctor will review the data from your monitor. The doctor will also look at your records of activities and symptoms and the times they occurred. Your doctor will compare the timing of your activities and symptoms with the recorded heart pattern.', \"If you have electrodes or pads on your skin, those places may itch slightly during the test. The skin on your chest may look or feel irritated when the electrodes are removed.\\n\\nHeart monitors are typically very lightweight. So carrying or wearing them is usually not uncomfortable.\\n\\nFor an implantable heart monitor, you will get medicine to numb the area of your chest where the monitor will be put in. You will be awake when the doctor makes a small cut and places the monitor under the skin. You shouldn't feel any pain.\", \"Complete Blood Count (CBC) Red Blood Cells White blood cells Atherosclerosis Adrenal glands Thyroid Gland Spleen Test Overview A complete blood count (CBC) gives important information about the kinds and numbers of cells in the blood, especially red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A CBC helps your doctor check any symptoms that you may have, such as weakness, fatigue, or bruising. A CBC also helps him or her diagnose conditions, such as anemia, infection, and many other disorders.\\n\\nA CBC test usually includes:\\n\\nWhite blood cell (WBC, leukocyte) count. White blood cells protect the body against infection. If an infection develops, white blood cells attack and destroy the bacteria, virus, or other organism causing it. White blood cells are bigger than red blood cells but fewer in number. When a person has a bacterial infection, the number of white cells rises very quickly. The number of white blood cells is sometimes used to find an infection or to see how the body is dealing with cancer treatment.\\n\\nWhite blood cell types (WBC differential). The major types of white blood cells are neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Immature neutrophils, called band neutrophils, are also part of this test. Each type of cell plays a different role in protecting the body. The numbers of each one of these types of white blood cells give important information about the immune system. Too many or too few of the different types of white blood cells can help find an infection, an allergic or toxic reaction to medicines or chemicals, and many conditions, such as leukemia.\\n\\nRed blood cell (RBC) count. Red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. They also carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs so it can be exhaled. If the RBC count is low (anemia), the body may not be getting the oxygen it needs. If the count is too high (a condition called polycythemia), there's a chance that the red blood cells will clump together and block tiny blood vessels (capillaries). This also makes it hard for your red blood cells to carry oxygen.\\n\\nHematocrit (HCT, packed cell volume, PCV). This test measures the amount of space (volume) red blood cells take up in the blood. The value is given as a percentage of red blood cells in a volume of blood. For example, a hematocrit of 38 means that 38% of the blood's volume is made of red blood cells. Hematocrit and hemoglobin values are the two major tests that show if anemia or polycythemia is present.\\n\\nHemoglobin (Hgb). The hemoglobin molecule fills up the red blood cells. It carries oxygen and gives the blood cell its red color. The hemoglobin test measures the amount of hemoglobin in blood. It's a good measure of how well the blood can carry oxygen throughout the body.\\n\\nRed blood cell indices. There are three red blood cell indices: mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). They are measured by a machine, and their values come from other measurements in a CBC. The MCV shows the size of the red blood cells. The MCH value is the amount of hemoglobin in an average red blood cell. The MCHC measures the concentration of hemoglobin in an average red blood cell. These numbers help in the diagnosis of different types of anemia. Red cell distribution width (RDW) can also be measured. It shows if the cells are all the same or different sizes or shapes.\\n\\nPlatelet (thrombocyte) count. Platelets (thrombocytes) are the smallest type of blood cell. They are important in blood clotting. When bleeding occurs, the platelets swell, clump together, and form a sticky plug that helps stop the bleeding. If there are too few platelets, uncontrolled bleeding may be a problem. If there are too many platelets, there is a chance of a blood clot forming in a blood vessel. Also, platelets may be involved in hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).\", 'Mean platelet volume (MPV). Mean platelet volume measures the average amount (volume) of platelets. MPV is used along with platelet count to diagnose some diseases. If the platelet count is normal, the MPV can still be too high or too low.\\n\\nA CBC may be done as part of a regular physical exam. There are many other reasons that a doctor may want this blood test, including to:\\n\\nFind the cause of symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, fever, bruising, or weight loss. Check for anemia. See how much blood has been lost if there is bleeding. Diagnose polycythemia. Check for an infection. Diagnose diseases of the blood, such as leukemia. Check how the body is dealing with some types of drug or radiation treatment. Check how abnormal bleeding is affecting the blood cells and counts. Screen for high and low values before a surgery. See if there are too many or too few of certain types of cells. This may help find other conditions. For instance, too many eosinophils may be a sign of an allergy or asthma. A blood count can give valuable information about the general state of your health.', \"cabazitaxel Pronunciation: ka BAZ i TAX el\\n\\nBrand: Jevtana\\n\\nWhat is the most important information I should know about cabazitaxel? Cabazitaxel affects your immune system. You may get infections more easily, even serious or fatal infections, especially if you are 65 or older.

Prediabetes is a warning sign that you are at risk for getting type 2 diabetes. It means that your blood sugar is higher than it should be, but not high enough to be diabetes. Prediabetes is also called impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose. Most people who get type 2 diabetes have prediabetes first.\\n\\nWhat causes prediabetes? The food you eat turns into sugar, which your body uses for energy. Normally, an organ called the pancreas makes insulin, which allows the sugar in your blood to get into your body's cells. But when your body can't use insulin the right way, the sugar doesn't move into cells. It stays in your blood instead. This is called insulin resistance. The buildup of sugar in the blood causes prediabetes.\\n\\nPeople who are overweight, aren't physically active, and have a family history of diabetes are more likely to get prediabetes. Women who have had gestational diabetes are also more likely to get prediabetes.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms? Most people with prediabetes don't have any symptoms. But if you have prediabetes, you need to watch for signs of diabetes, such as:\\n\\nFeeling very thirsty. Urinating more often than usual. Feeling very hungry. Having blurred vision. Losing weight without trying. How is prediabetes diagnosed? A blood test can tell if you have prediabetes. You have prediabetes if:\\n\\nThe results of your hemoglobin A1c test are 5.7 percent to 6.4. The results of your fasting blood glucose test are between 100 and 125 milligrams per deciliter. The results of your oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) are 140 to 199 mg/dL (2 hours after the beginning of the test). How is it treated? The key to treating prediabetes and preventing type 2 diabetes is getting your blood sugar levels back to a normal range. You can do this by making some lifestyle changes.\\n\\nWatch your weight. If you are overweight, losing just a small amount of weight may help. Reducing fat around your waist is particularly important. Make healthy food choices. Limit the amount of unhealthy fat you eat, such as saturated fat and trans fat. Try to cut calories and limit sweets. Be active. You can do moderate activity, vigorous activity, or both. Bit by bit, increase the amount you do every day. You may want to swim, bike, or do other activities. Walking is an easy way to get exercise. Making these changes may help delay or prevent diabetes. You may also avoid or delay some of the serious problems that you can get when you have diabetes, such as heart attack, stroke, and heart, eye, nerve, and kidney disease.\\n\\nYou may need to take a diabetes medicine called metformin. It reduces the amount of sugar made by the liver in people who are insulin-resistant.\\n\\nCan prediabetes be prevented? Staying at a healthy weight, eating healthy foods, and getting regular exercise can help prevent prediabetes.\", \"What is heart failure? Heart failure means that your heart muscle doesn't pump as much blood as your body needs. Failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped. It means that your heart is not pumping as well as it should. Because your heart cannot pump well, your body tries to make up for it. To do this: Your body holds on to salt and water. This increases the amount of blood in your bloodstream. Your heart beats faster. Your heart may get bigger. Your body has an amazing ability to make up for heart failure. It may do such a good job that you don't know you have a disease. But at some point, your heart and body will no longer be able to keep up. Then fluid starts to build up in your body, and you have symptoms like feeling weak and out of breath. This fluid buildup is called congestion. It's why some doctors call the disease congestive heart failure. Heart failure usually gets worse over time. But treatment can slow the disease and help you feel better and live longer. What causes heart failure? Anything that damages your heart or affects how well it pumps can lead to heart failure. Common causes of heart failure are: High blood pressure. Heart attack. Coronary artery disease. Other conditions that can lead to heart failure include: Diabetes. Diseases of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathies). Heart valve disease. Disease of the sac around the heart (pericardial disease), such as pericarditis. A slow, fast, or uneven heart rhythm (arrhythmia).\\n\\nA heart problem that you were born with (congenital heart defect). Long-term heavy alcohol use, which can damage your heart. What are the symptoms? Symptoms of heart failure start to happen when your heart cannot pump enough blood to the rest of your body. In the early stages, you may: Feel tired easily. Be short of breath when you exert yourself. Feel like your heart is pounding or racing (palpitations). Feel weak or dizzy. As heart failure gets worse, fluid starts to build up in your lungs and other parts of your body. This may cause you to: Feel short of breath even at rest. Have swelling (edema), especially in your legs, ankles, and feet. Gain weight. This may happen over just a day or two, or more slowly. Cough or wheeze, especially when you lie down. Feel bloated or sick to your stomach. If your symptoms suddenly get worse, you will need emergency care. How is heart failure diagnosed? Your doctor may diagnose heart failure based on your symptoms and a physical exam. But you will need tests to find the cause and type of heart failure so that you can get the right treatment. These tests may include: Blood tests. A chest X-ray. An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) to check your heart's electrical system. An echocardiogram to see the size and shape of your heart and how well it is pumping. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to see the structure of your heart and check how well it is pumping.\", \"Echocardiogram An echocardiogram can help show if you have heart failure, what type it is, and what is causing it. Your doctor can also use it to see if your heart failure is getting worse. This test can measure how much blood your heart pumps to your body. This measurement is called the ejection fraction. If your ejection fraction gets lower and you are having more symptoms, it means that your heart failure is getting worse. How is it treated? Most people with heart failure need to take several medicines. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to: Help keep heart failure from getting worse. These drugs include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, and vasodilators like hydralazine and a nitrate. Reduce symptoms so you feel better. These drugs include diuretics (water pills) and digoxin. Treat the cause of your heart failure. It is very important to take your medicines exactly as your doctor tells you to. If you don't, your heart failure could get worse. Pacemaker or defibrillator A pacemaker or a defibrillator (such as an ICD) may be an option for you if you have a problem with your heart rhythm. A pacemaker can help your heart pump blood better. A defibrillator can prevent a dangerous heart-rhythm problem. Care at home Lifestyle changes are an important part of treatment. They can help slow down heart failure.\\n\\nThey may also help control other diseases that make heart failure worse, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. The best steps you can take are to: Eat less sodium. Sodium causes your body to hold on to water and may make symptoms worse. Your doctor may also ask you to limit how much fluid you drink. Get regular exercise. Your doctor can tell you what level of exercise is safe for you, how to check your pulse, and how to know if you are doing too much. Take rest breaks during the day. Lose weight if you are overweight. Even a few pounds can make a difference. Stop smoking. Smoking damages your heart and makes exercise harder to do. Limit alcohol. Ask your doctor how much, if any, is safe. Ask your doctor if cardiac rehab is right for you. Rehab can give you education and support that help you learn self-care and build new healthy habits, such as exercise and healthy eating. To stay as healthy as possible, work closely with your doctor. Have all your tests, and go to all your appointments. It is also important to: Talk to your doctor before you take any new medicine, including nonprescription and prescription drugs, vitamins, and herbs. Some of them may make your heart failure worse. Keep track of your symptoms. Weigh yourself at the same time every day, and write down your weight. Call your doctor if you have a sudden weight gain, a change in your ability to exercise, or any sudden change in your symptoms.\\n\\nWhat can you expect if you have heart failure? Medicines and lifestyle changes can slow or even reverse heart failure for some people. But heart failure often gets worse over time. Early on, your symptoms may not be too bad. As heart failure gets worse, you may need to limit your activities. Treatment can often help reduce symptoms, but it usually doesn't get rid of them. Heart failure can also lead to other health problems. These may include: Trouble with your heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Stroke. Heart attack. Mitral valve regurgitation. Blood clots in your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs (pulmonary embolism). Your doctor may be able to give you medicine or other treatment to prevent or treat these problems. Heart failure can get worse suddenly. If this happens, you will need emergency care. To prevent sudden heart failure, you need to avoid things that can trigger it. These include eating too much salt, missing a dose of your medicine, and exercising too hard. Knowing that your health may get worse can be hard. It is normal to sometimes feel sad or hopeless. But if these feelings last, talk to your doctor. Antidepressant medicines, counseling, or both may help you cope.\", 'What is Sjögren\\'s syndrome? Sjögren\\'s syndrome (say \"SHOH-grins\") is a disease in which the immune system attacks the glands that make moisture for the body, such as tears and saliva.

Chronic pain is pain that lasts for 3 months or longer. It can make you sleep poorly, feel tired and irritable, and have a hard time being active or working. It may strain your relationships with loved ones too, making it hard to be the kind of friend, parent, or partner you want to be. You may feel stressed or get depressed or anxious. And these feelings may make your pain worse, because they can make it harder to manage your pain.\\n\\nLearning how to control your pain can help with all of these things. In most cases, chronic pain can be managed so that you can get on with your life and do your daily activities. One way you can help manage and cope with your pain is through healthy thinking. Your thoughts are something you can control. You can learn techniques to make your thoughts more helpful and encouraging.\\n\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy, also called CBT, is a way to help you stay well and cope with pain by changing how you think. And how you think affects how you feel. Negative thoughts can make stress and pain worse. Healthy thinking can help. CBT is often used to help people think in a healthier, more balanced way. The goal is to change the way you think about pain so that your body and mind respond better when you have pain. Another technique, called acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), helps you cope with chronic pain by helping you learn to accept negative feelings. You learn to base your choices and actions on your personal values, rather than on negative feelings. Healthy thinking can take away barriers to being physically active, such as discouraging thoughts. This helps because pain can also improve with physical activity, such as walking and swimming. Changing your thinking will take some time. Be patient with yourself as you learn healthy thinking. It may not feel right at first, because you are trying out something new. But with daily practice, it will get easier and feel more natural. And it\\'s something you can start doing today. Many people work with a therapist or a counselor to learn CBT techniques. But you also can practice some of them on your own.\\n\\nWorking on your own or with a counselor, you can practice these three steps:\\n\\nStop. Notice your thoughts. When you notice a negative thought, stop it in its tracks and write it down. Ask. Look at that thought and ask yourself whether it is helpful or unhelpful. Choose. Choose a new, helpful thought to replace a negative one. Ask yourself: What effect does believing this thought have on me? What might happen if I tried to believe the more healthy thought? The goal is to have encouraging thoughts come naturally. It may take some time to change the way you think. You will need to practice healthy thinking every day.\\n\\nNotice and stop your thoughts The first step is to notice and stop your negative thoughts or \"self-talk.\" Self-talk is what you think and believe about yourself and your experiences. It\\'s like a running commentary in your head. Your self-talk may be rational and helpful. Or it may be negative and not helpful.\\n\\nAsk about your thoughts The next step is to ask yourself whether your thoughts are helpful or unhelpful. Does the evidence support your negative thought? Some of your self-talk may be true. Or it may be partly true but exaggerated. Here are a few types of unhelpful thoughts to look for:', 'Focusing on the negative: This is sometimes called filtering. You filter out the good and focus only on the bad. Example: \"I\\'ve had some good days, but having one good day doesn\\'t mean that I will have more.\" Reality: Just like life, not all days are good. But that doesn\\'t mean every day will be bad. Having pain-free days means that you are capable of having them, and more lie ahead. Should: People sometimes have set ideas about how they \"should\" act. If you hear yourself saying that you or other people \"should,\" \"ought to,\" or \"have to\" do something, then you might be setting yourself up to feel bad. Example: \"If I take all my medicines as prescribed, then I should have no pain.\" Reality: There\\'s nothing wrong with expecting that medicines should work. But managing chronic pain sometimes takes many different resources, including medicines, to get the best results. Overgeneralizing: This is taking one example and saying it\\'s true for everything. Look for words such as \"never\" and \"always.\" Example: \"There\\'s nothing I can do to help the pain.\" Reality: On some days, pain may seem overwhelming. But dwelling on that causes you to focus on the pain, which can make it worse. Instead, try to focus on ways you can work with the pain. What was different in previous times when the pain wasn\\'t so consuming? How did you cope then? Can some of those strategies help? All-or-nothing thinking: This is also called black-or-white thinking.\\n\\nExample: \"I have a hard time sitting for very long, so I can\\'t go back to work.\" Reality: With some creative thinking, you may be able to work out an alternative seating arrangement or a flexible work schedule. Choose your thoughts The next step is to choose a more helpful thought to replace the unhelpful one.\\n\\nKeeping a journal of your thoughts is one of the best ways to practice stopping, asking, and choosing your thoughts. It makes you aware of your self-talk. Write down any negative or unhelpful thoughts you had during the day. If you think you might not remember at the end of your day, keep a notepad with you so you can write down any unhelpful thoughts as they happen. Then write down a helpful message to correct the unhelpful thought.\\n\\nWith daily practice, more accurate and helpful thoughts will soon come naturally to you.\\n\\nBut there may be some truth in some of your negative thoughts. You may have some things you want to work on. If you didn\\'t perform as well as you would like on something, write that down. You can work on a plan to correct or improve that area.\\n\\nIf you want, you also could write down what kind of unhelpful thought you had.', 'Planning to Be More Active When You Have Chronic Disease\\n\\nUse this sheet to list what you enjoy and what is hard for you. You and your doctor can use this information to come up with an activity plan.\\n\\nHow active are you? Describe what you do to stretch, strengthen, and move your body. Write down how often and how long you do each activity.\\n\\nWhat would you like to do? List ways you might like to get more active. And think of someone you can buddy up with for exercise.\\n\\nWhat gets in your way? Which of the problems below are you worried about when it comes to getting more active? How might you handle these problems? Who can help you?\\n\\nBreathing trouble, balance problems, or pain\\n\\nHurting yourself\\n\\nFeeling tired or depressed\\n\\nTrouble with daily tasks\\n\\nProblems with money, time, or travel\\n\\nSomething else\\n\\nWhat medical problems are you dealing with? List all of the health problems you are having.\\n\\nSome questions for your doctor:\\n\\nDo I need any special tests before I begin a new activity? What is safe for me to do? What should I avoid? Should I take my pulse when I exercise? If so, what range is best? Should I make any medicine changes? Write down any other questions you might have about getting more active. Talk to your doctor about them at your next visit.\\n\\nWhat is your plan for getting more active over the next week? People tend to have more success with long-term goals that are broken into small, short-term goals. You can boost your chances of success in two more ways: include friends and family you can count on for support and reward yourself for the positive changes you are making.\\n\\nWhat is your plan for being active 3 months from now?']\n",
